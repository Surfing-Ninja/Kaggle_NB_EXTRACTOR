# Dataset Usage Guide

## Overview
This dataset contains 130 high-quality Kaggle notebooks focused on feature engineering and machine learning.

## Structure
```
notebooks_curated/
├── pure_fe/              # Feature engineering focused
├── eda_fe/               # EDA + feature engineering
├── hyperparam_fe/        # Hyperparameter tuning + FE
├── complete_pipeline/    # Complete ML pipelines
└── advanced/             # Advanced ML techniques
```

## Quality Scoring
