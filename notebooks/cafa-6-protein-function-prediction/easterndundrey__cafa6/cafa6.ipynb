Original had ~31M, this might have ~5M\n\n### 3. **No Handling of Missing Values** \n- When predictions are missing from one model, they become NaN\n- Should fill with 0 (no confidence) but we don't\n- Results in NaN final scores = invalid predictions\n\n### 4. **Equal Weights** \n- Original used `[0.2, 0.8]` weights because one model performs better\n- This uses `[0.5, 0.5]` - treats bad and good models equally\n- Drags down performance significantly\n\n### 5. **No Data Validation** \n- Missing `dropna()` checks for malformed rows\n- No dtype specifications in `read_csv`\n- No handling of duplicate predictions\n\n### 6. **Inefficient Processing** \n- No temporary file system for large operations\n- Keeps everything in memory all the time\n- No progress tracking for long operations\n\n### 7. **Lost Edge Cases** \n- Removed the clever `key` concatenation approach\n- Doesn't handle proteins/GO terms with underscores properly\n- Direct merge on two columns is less robust\n\n### 8. **Score Distribution Issues** \n- Simple averaging can create weird score distributions\n- No normalization or calibration\n- Weighted ensemble preserves confidence levels better\n\n## Performance Impact:\n\n- **Original**: Processes all 31.5M predictions efficiently\n- **This version**: \n  - Will crash due to memory on most systems\n  - If it runs, loses 80%+ of predictions due to inner merge\n  - Remaining predictions have equal-weight averaging \n  - Competition score would be bad\n\n## What Makes the Original Good:\n\nMemory-efficient chunking for huge datasets\n\nOuter merge preserves ALL predictions from both models\n\nProper filling of missing values (0 for absent predictions)\n\nWeighted ensemble based on model quality\n\nRobust handling of edge cases with key concatenation\n\nProgress tracking and temporary file management\n\nData validation and error handling\n","metadata":{}}]}
