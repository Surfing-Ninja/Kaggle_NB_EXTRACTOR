This notebook details a robust and computationally efficient framework designed for the CAFA 6 challenge. Our approach circumvents the need for computationally expensive structural alignments by leveraging the power of pre-trained protein language models (pLMs). Specifically, we generate fixed-length vector representations (embeddings) for each protein sequence using the ProtT5 model. These embeddings are then used as input to a multi-label classification system. To tackle the hierarchical and multi-label nature of the Gene Ontology (GO), we employ a \"one-vs-rest\" strategy with a set of lightweight, efficient classifiers (Logistic Regression) for each GO term. We detail our methodology, from data preprocessing and feature extraction to model training and the generation of a compliant submission file.

Introduction**\n\nProteins are the primary executors of biological functions within a cell [1]. The exponential growth of sequencing data has resulted in a vast \"sequence-function gap,\" where millions of protein sequences are known, but their precise biological roles remain uncharacterized [2]. The Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation (CAFA) is a community-wide experiment designed to systematically evaluate computational methods for protein function prediction [3, 4].\n\nThe challenge lies in assigning Gene Ontology (GO) terms—a structured vocabulary describing a protein's molecular function (MF), biological process (BP), and cellular component (CC)—based solely on its amino acid sequence. This task is inherently a large-scale, multi-label, hierarchical classification problem [5].\n\nTraditional methods often rely on sequence similarity searches (e.g., BLAST) [6], protein-protein interaction networks [7], or structural homology [8]. However, these methods can be limited for proteins with few known homologs. Recently, protein language models (pLMs), such as ProtT5 [9], have revolutionized the field by learning rich, context-aware representations of protein sequences from massive unlabeled datasets. These \"embeddings\" capture latent biophysical and evolutionary information without requiring explicit alignments.\n\nThis work proposes a computationally tractable framework that leverages ProtT5 embeddings as its primary feature set. We hypothesize that these rich embeddings, when coupled with a simple yet scalable classification architecture, can achieve competitive performance within the strict resource constraints of the competition. This document provides a rigorous, step-by-step implementation of our methodology.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# ==============================================================================\n# 1.

Mathematical and Methodological Framework**\n\n### **2.1. Problem Formulation**\n\nLet $\\mathcal{P} = \\{p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_N\\}$ be the set of $N$ protein sequences in the training set, and $\\mathcal{G} = \\{g_1, g_2, \\dots, g_M\\}$ be the set of all possible Gene Ontology (GO) terms. The training data is a set of pairs $(p_i, G_i)$, where $G_i \\subseteq \\mathcal{G}$ is the set of known GO terms for protein $p_i$.\n\nThe task is to learn a function $f: p \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^M$ that, for any given protein sequence $p$, outputs a vector of prediction scores $\\mathbf{\\hat{y}} = (\\hat{y}_1, \\hat{y}_2, \\dots, \\hat{y}_M)$, where $\\hat{y}_j \\in [0, 1]$ is the predicted probability that protein $p$ is associated with GO term $g_j$.\n\n**Equation 1: The Prediction Function**\n$$\nf(p) = \\mathbf{\\hat{y}}\n$$\n\nThe evaluation metric is the maximum F1-score ($F_{max}$), calculated as a weighted average across the three GO sub-ontologies (BP, MF, CC). For a set of predictions at a given threshold $\\tau$, precision and recall for a single protein are defined as:\n\n**Table 1: Evaluation Metrics per Protein**\n| Metric | Formula |\n|---|---|\n| Precision($\\tau$) | $Pr(\\tau) = \\frac{|\\{j | \\hat{y}_j \\geq \\tau\\} \\cap G_i|}{|\\{j | \\hat{y}_j \\geq \\tau\\}|}$ |\n| Recall($\\tau$) | $Re(\\tau) = \\frac{|\\{j | \\hat{y}_j \\geq \\tau\\} \\cap G_i|}{|G_i|}$ |\n\nThe F1-score at threshold $\\tau$ is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. $F_{max}$ is the maximum F1-score over all possible thresholds.\n\n**Equation 4: F-max Definition**\n$$\nF_{max} = \\max_{\\tau \\in [0, 1]} \\left( \\frac{2 \\cdot Pr(\\tau) \\cdot Re(\\tau)}{Pr(\\tau) + Re(\\tau)} \\right)\n$$\n\n### **2.2. Protein Sequence Representation via Language Models**\n\nA protein sequence $p$ is a string of amino acids from an alphabet $\\mathcal{AA}$ of size 20. We use a pre-trained protein language model (pLM), specifically ProtT5, to transform this sequence into a fixed-length numerical vector, or embedding.\n\nThe pLM, denoted $\\Phi$, maps a sequence of length $L$ to a sequence of hidden states $\\mathbf{H} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d_{embed}}$.\n\n**Equation 5: Sequence to Hidden States**\n$$\n\\Phi(p) = \\mathbf{H} = (\\mathbf{h}_1, \\mathbf{h}_2, \\dots, \\mathbf{h}_L)\n$$\n\nTo obtain a single vector representation for the entire protein, we perform a mean-pooling operation over the length dimension.\n\n**Equation 6: Final Protein Embedding**\n$$\n\\mathbf{e}_p = \\frac{1}{L} \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\mathbf{h}_i\n$$\n\nThis embedding $\\mathbf{e}_p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{embed}}$ serves as the input features for our downstream classification model.

Data Loading, Parsing, and Initial Exploration**\n\nThe foundation of any robust bioinformatics prediction model is a meticulously prepared dataset. In this section, we load all the raw data provided by the CAFA6 organizers. This includes the protein sequences, the ground-truth annotations (GO terms), the ontology structure itself, and the term-specific weights (Information Accretion).\n\n### **2.1. Data Sources and Formats**\n\nThe competition provides data in several standard bioinformatics formats:\n- **FASTA (`.fasta`):** Used for protein sequences. Each entry contains a header (with the protein ID) and the amino acid sequence.\n- **Tab-Separated Values (`.tsv`):** Used for tabular data like training terms and taxonomy.\n- **Open Biomedical Ontologies (`.obo`):** A standard format for representing ontologies like the Gene Ontology.\n\n### **2.2. Parsing the Gene Ontology (GO)**\n\nThe GO structure is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), not a simple tree. Understanding this hierarchy is critical because an annotation to a specific term (e.g., \"catalytic activity\") implies annotation to all of its parent terms (e.g., \"molecular function\"). We will use the `obonet` library to parse this graph into a `networkx` object, which allows for efficient traversal of these hierarchical relationships.\n\n**Table 3: Key Attributes of the Gene Ontology Graph**\n| Attribute | Description | Example |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Node ID** | The unique GO term identifier. | `GO:0003674` |\n| **Node Name** | The human-readable name of the term. | `molecular_function` |\n| **Namespace**| The sub-ontology (BP, MF, or CC). | `molecular_function` |\n| **Edges** | The relationships between terms (e.g., `is_a`).| `GO:0003824` is_a `GO:0003674`|\n\nWe will also map the three root nodes of the ontology, which will be essential for separating our predictions later.\n\n**Equation 7: GO Root Nodes**\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\{ g_{BP}, g_{MF}, g_{CC} \\}\n$$\nWhere $g_{BP} = \\text{'GO:0008150'}$, $g_{MF} = \\text{'GO:0003674'}$, and $g_{CC} = \\text{'GO:0005575'}$.\n\nThis initial loading and parsing phase ensures that all necessary components are available for the subsequent feature engineering and model training steps.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# ==============================================================================\n# 3.

Feature Engineering: Protein Language Model Embeddings**\n\nThe core of our feature engineering strategy is the use of pre-trained protein language models (pLMs). These models have been trained on vast databases of protein sequences (e.g., UniRef) and have learned to capture the intricate \"language\" of protein biology, including evolutionary and structural information, directly from the amino acid sequence.\n\n### **3.1. The Transformer Architecture**\nWe use the **ProtT5-XL-U50** model [9], which is based on the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) architecture [10]. The Transformer's key innovation is the **self-attention mechanism**, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different amino acids in the sequence when creating a representation for a specific position.\n\n**Equation 7: Scaled Dot-Product Attention**\nThe attention score is calculated as:\n$$\n\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V\n$$\nwhere $Q$ (Query), $K$ (Key), and $V$ (Value) are linear projections of the input sequence embeddings, and $d_k$ is the dimension of the keys.\n\nThe model uses **Multi-Head Attention** to capture different types of relationships simultaneously.\n\n**Equation 8: Multi-Head Attention**\n$$\n\\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \\text{Concat}(\\text{head}_1, \\dots, \\text{head}_h)W^O\n$$\nwhere each $\\text{head}_i = \\text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)$.\n\n### **3.2.

Prediction and Submission File Generation**\n\nWith our ensemble of One-vs-Rest classifiers trained, the next critical step is to generate predictions on the `testsuperset.fasta` file. This process involves several key stages to ensure our submission is both accurate and compliant with the competition's rules.\n\n### **5.1. Test Set Feature Extraction**\n\nFirst, we must generate the same ProtT5 embeddings for the test sequences that we used for training. As previously discussed, this step is simulated by loading a pre-computed embedding file to adhere to the offline submission requirement.\n\n**Table 11: Test Set Data Shapes**\n| Data Component | Shape / Size | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| Test Sequences | `~50,000+` | The number of proteins in `testsuperset.fasta`. |\n| Test Embeddings (X_test) | `(N_test, 1024)` | The feature matrix for the test set. |\n\n### **5.2. Prediction Aggregation**\n\nWe will iterate through our dictionary of trained classifiers. For each GO term where a classifier was successfully trained, we will predict the probability for all test proteins. This will result in a prediction matrix $\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_{test} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N_{test} \\times M}$.\n\n**Equation 14: Test Prediction Matrix**\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_{test} = [\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}_1, \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}_2, \\dots, \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}_{N_{test}}]^T\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}_i = (f_1(\\mathbf{e}_i), f_2(\\mathbf{e}_i), \\dots, f_M(\\mathbf{e}_i))$ for the $i$-th test protein.\n\n### **5.3. GO Hierarchy Propagation**\n\nA crucial rule of the CAFA challenge is that predictions must be consistent with the GO hierarchy. If a protein is predicted to have a specific function (a child term), it must also be predicted to have all of its parent functions up to the root.\n\nTo ensure this, we will apply a propagation rule: the score of any parent term is updated to be the maximum score among all of its children's scores present in our prediction set.\n\n**Equation 15: Propagation Rule**\nFor any term $g_j$ with a set of children $C(g_j)$:\n$$\n\\hat{y}_j \\leftarrow \\max(\\hat{y}_j, \\max_{g_k \\in C(g_j)} \\hat{y}_k)\n$$\nThis process is applied recursively from the deepest terms up to the root of each sub-ontology.\n\n### **5.4. Submission Formatting**\n\nThe final submission file must be a tab-separated `.tsv` file without a header, containing three columns: `Protein ID`, `GO Term ID`, and `Probability Score`. We will filter out any predictions below a minimal threshold to keep the file size manageable and only report meaningful predictions, adhering to the limit of 1500 terms per protein.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# ==============================================================================\n# 6.

Conclusion and Future Work**\n\nThis notebook has presented a complete, end-to-end framework for the CAFA 6 Protein Function Prediction challenge, optimized for a CPU-only environment. Our methodology successfully leveraged the rich feature representations from the ProtT5 protein language model and combined them with a scalable One-vs-Rest classification strategy using Logistic Regression. Key steps, including the careful selection of target labels and the critical enforcement of GO hierarchy consistency, were implemented to create a robust and compliant submission.\n\nThe primary strength of this approach lies in its computational efficiency. By pre-computing embeddings and using a fast, linear classifier, we can tackle this large-scale multi-label problem within the strict time limits of the competition without requiring GPU acceleration.\n\n### **6.1. Potential Avenues for Improvement**\n\nWhile this framework provides a strong baseline, several avenues for future improvement exist:\n1.  **More Advanced Classifiers:** While Logistic Regression is fast, non-linear models like LightGBM or small Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) could be trained for each GO term to potentially capture more complex relationships in the embedding space. This would come at a higher computational cost.\n2.  **Hierarchical Classification Models:** Instead of treating each label independently (OvR), a true hierarchical classifier that explicitly models the parent-child relationships in the GO graph during training could improve consistency and accuracy.\n3.  **Multi-Modal Feature Fusion:** This model relies solely on sequence embeddings. Integrating other data sources, as suggested by recent literature [13, 14], such as protein-protein interaction networks, structural information from AlphaFold [15], or taxonomic data, would likely provide a significant performance boost.\n4.  **Ensemble of Embeddings:** Relying on a single pLM (ProtT5) is effective, but ensembling embeddings from multiple pLMs (e.g., ProtT5, ESM-2, Ankh) could create a more robust and comprehensive feature representation.\n\nThis work serves as a strong and reproducible baseline, demonstrating the power of pLM embeddings in a computationally constrained environment.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **7.
