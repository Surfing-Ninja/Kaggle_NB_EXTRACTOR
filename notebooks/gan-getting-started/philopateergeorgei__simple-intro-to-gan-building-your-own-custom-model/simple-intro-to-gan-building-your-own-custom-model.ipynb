A GAN stands for Generative Adversarial Network. It is a way of making new things that look like real things, such as images, sounds, or texts. For example, a GAN can make new images of cats that look like real cats, but are not actually real cats.\n\nA GAN has two parts: a generator and a discriminator. The generator’s job is to make new things, and the discriminator’s job is to tell if the things are real or fake. The generator and the discriminator are like two players in a game. The generator tries to fool the discriminator by making fake things that look real, and the discriminator tries to catch the generator by telling if the things are real or fake. The generator and the discriminator learn from each other and get better at their jobs over time.\n\nThe code defines a class called GAN_MODEL that inherits from another class called ks.models.Model. A class is like a blueprint that tells how to make something. In this case, the class tells how to make a GAN model.\n\nThe first part of the code is the __init__ method. This method is like a constructor that tells how to create an instance of the class. An instance is like an object that is made from the blueprint. In this case, the method tells how to create a GAN model object.\n\nThe method takes four arguments: generator, discriminator, *args, and **kwargs. The first two arguments are the generator and the discriminator models that are used to make the GAN model. The last two arguments are special symbols that mean any other arguments that are not specified.\n\nThe method calls another method called super().__init__(*args, **kwargs). This method is like calling the constructor of the parent class, which is ks.models.Model. This means that the GAN model object will have all the features of the parent class, plus some extra features that are defined in the child class.\n\nThe method then creates two attributes for the GAN model object: self.generator and self.discriminator. These attributes are like variables that store some values inside the object. In this case, they store the generator and the discriminator models that are passed as arguments.\n\nThe second part of the code is the compile method. This method is like a preparer that tells how to get ready for training the model. Training is like teaching the model how to do its job.\n\nThe method takes six arguments: genrator_optimezer, detector_optimizer, gen_loss, detector_loss, *args, and **kwargs. The first four arguments are some tools that are used to train the model. The last two arguments are again special symbols that mean any other arguments that are not specified.\n\nThe method calls another method called super().compile(*args, **kwargs). This method is like calling the preparer of the parent class, which is ks.models.Model. This means that the GAN model object will get ready for training using all the tools of the parent class, plus some extra tools that are defined in the child class.\n\nThe method then creates four more attributes for the GAN model object: self.g_opt, self.d_opt, self.g_loss, and self.d_loss. These attributes store the tools that are passed as arguments.\n\nThe third part of the code is the train_step method. This method is like a trainer that tells how to train the model for one step. A step is like one round of playing the game between the generator and the discriminator.\n\nThe method takes one argument: batch. This argument is like a bunch of data that is used to train the model. In this case, it is a bunch of real images.\n\nThe method does several things:\n\nIt gets some data by assigning real_images to be equal to batch. This means that it uses the bunch of real images as data.\nIt makes some new things by calling self.generator(tf.random.normal((input_shape)), training=False) and assigning it to be equal to fake_images. This means that it uses the generator model to make some fake images from some random numbers.\nIt trains the discriminator by doing these things:\nIt passes both real and fake images to the discriminator model by calling self.discriminator(real_images, training=True) and self.discriminator(fake_images, training=True) and assigning them to be equal to yhat_real and yhat_fake. These mean that it gets some predictions from the discriminator model about whether the images are real or fake.\nIt combines both predictions into one by calling tf.concat([yhat_real, yhat_fake], axis=0) and assigning it to be equal to yhat_realfake. This means that it puts the predictions together in one list.\nIt creates some labels for real and fake images by calling tf.concat([tf.zeros_like(yhat_real), tf.ones_like(yhat_fake)], axis=0) and assigning it to be equal to y_realfake. This means that it makes a list of zeros and ones, where zeros mean real and ones mean fake.\nIt adds some noise to the labels by doing these things:\nIt makes some random numbers between 0 and 0.15 by calling 0.15*tf.random.uniform(tf.shape(yhat_real)) and 0.15*tf.random.uniform(tf.shape(yhat_fake)) and assigning them to be equal to noise_real and noise_fake. This means that it makes some small numbers that are different for each prediction.\nIt adds the noise to the labels by calling tf.concat([noise_real, noise_fake], axis=0) and adding it to y_realfake. This means that it makes the labels a little bit different from zeros and ones, so that they are not too easy or too hard for the discriminator model to learn.\nIt calculates the loss by calling self.d_loss(y_realfake, yhat_realfake) and assigning it to be equal to total_d_loss. This means that it measures how well the discriminator model did its job by comparing the labels and the predictions. The loss is like a score that tells how much the discriminator model needs to improve.\nIt applies backpropagation by doing these things:\nIt calculates the gradients by calling d_tape.gradient(total_d_loss, self.discriminator.trainable_variables) and assigning it to be equal to dgrad. This means that it finds out how much each part of the discriminator model contributed to the loss.\nIt updates the discriminator model by calling self.d_opt.apply_gradients(zip(dgrad, self.discriminator.trainable_variables)). This means that it changes the parts of the discriminator model a little bit, so that they can do better next time.\nIt trains the generator by doing these things:\nIt makes some new images by calling self.generator(tf.random.normal((input_shape)), training=True) and assigning it to be equal to gen_images. This means that it uses the generator model to make some more fake images from some random numbers.\nIt creates some predicted labels by calling self.discriminator(gen_images, training=False) and assigning it to be equal to predicted_labels. This means that it gets some predictions from the discriminator model about whether the new fake images are real or fake.\nIt calculates the loss by calling self.g_loss(tf.zeros_like(predicted_labels), predicted_labels) and assigning it to be equal to total_g_loss. This means that it measures how well the generator model did its job by comparing the predictions with zeros. The loss is like a score that tells how much the generator model needs to improve. The generator model wants to make fake images that look real, so it wants the predictions to be close to zeros.\nIt applies backpropagation by doing these things:\nIt calculates the gradients by calling g_tape.gradient(total_g_loss, self.generator.trainable_variables) and assigning it to be equal to ggrad. This means that it finds out how much each part of the generator model contributed to the loss.\nIt updates the generator model by calling self.g_opt.apply_gradients(zip(ggrad, self.generator.trainable_variables)). This means that it changes the parts of the generator model a little bit, so that they can do better next time.\nThe method then returns a dictionary with two values: \"detector_loss\" and \"generator_loss\". A dictionary is like a container that stores some values with some names. In this case, it stores the losses of both models with their names.\n\nThe last part of the code is outside of the class definition. It does these things:\n\nIt creates a GAN model object called fashgan by calling GAN_MODEL(generator, detector). This means that it uses the blueprint of the class to make an object with a generator model and a discriminator model as arguments.\nIt prepares the GAN model object for training by calling fashgan.compile(genrator_optimezer, detector_optimizer, gen_loss, detector_loss). This means that it uses the preparer method of the class with some tools as arguments.\nIt checks if there are any callbacks or validation data by using some if-else statements.
