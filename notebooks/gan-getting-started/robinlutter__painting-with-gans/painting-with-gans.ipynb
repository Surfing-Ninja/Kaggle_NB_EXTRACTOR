Project Topic\n\nGitHub Repo: https://github.com/wr0b1n/MSDS-5511-Week5\n\nIn this competition, we will use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to recreate Claude Monet's artistic style in images. GANs consist of a generator and discriminator, where the generator produces Monet-style images, and the discriminator distinguishes real from generated ones. The goal is to generate 7,000 to 10,000 Monet-style images that will be evaluated on the MiFID (Memorization-informed Fréchet Inception Distance).\n\nGenerative Deep Learning models are a subset of deep learning models designed to generate new data samples that resemble a given dataset. These models are used in various applications, such as image generation, text generation, and more. The key idea behind generative models is to learn the underlying distribution of the training data and then sample from this distribution to create new data samples.\n\nGANs in particular are a powerful class of generative models that consist of two neural networks, namely a generator and a discriminator that are trained adversarially. The goal of the generator is to create realistic data samples, while the discriminator tries to decide between real and fake samples. This adversarial training process results in the generator improving its ability to produce high-quality, realistic data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2. Data\n\nWe are provided with monet paintings both in JPG and TFRecords format as our training data. In case of the JPG data we have about 300 image files. For generating new images we are provided with 7038 photos (again in JPG and TFRecords format). These photos will be manipulated by our model in order get the monet style and make them look like real monet paintings.\n\nSince we are working with a large amount of image data we will probably face extremely long computation time. For this reason we will need to activate the TPU accelerator in the Kaggle notebook.\n\nBoth the monet paintings as well as the photos have a size of 256x256 pixels. The submission format is a zip-file containing 7,000-10,000 images sized 256x256 as well. ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 3.

An automated tuning process would result in training times that were too long considering the running time of the whole notebook is already quite long. Since the available usage time for the GPU on Kaggle is limited, I had to make some compromise by tuning only the learning rate and the beta value of the optimizer manually. I tried out different combination during the project, but only left the ones yielding the best results in the code see before. \n\nThe values are the following:\n\n* Starting learning rate: 2e-4\n* Betas of optimizer: 0.5 and 0.999\n\nConsidering the limited resources in this project the results seem to be quite good.

RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation) is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm. Is uses a moving average of the squared gradients to adjust the learning rate, while Adam also includes a term to correct for bias (momentum). There are two main advantages using RMSprop. First, is can be more stable than Adam in some cases, as it doesn't include the momentum term, which might result in smaller updates and reduce the likelihood of divergence during training. And second, RMSprop can lead to faster convergence in certain situations, especially when dealing with non-stationary or noisy gradients. However, the final results did not differ much from the Adam optimizer, which is why I kept the Adam version in the code.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 6.

An often underestimated but highly valuable practice in this regard is the strategic use of print statements within your code.
