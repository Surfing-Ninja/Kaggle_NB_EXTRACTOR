What you'll do here is create a model that can determine if radio signals come from a pulsar. Pulsars are a rare type of neutron stars that produce radio signals we can detect on Earth. As the pulsars rotate, the beam of radio waves points directly at us, then moves away. This leads to a periodic signal that we can use to determine if the radio signal is actually from a pulsar or just noise.\n\nThe data itself contains eight measures of this radio signal and a column `target_class` that indicates if the signal is noise (0) or a pulsar (1). Using this data, you'll train a classifier that can identify pulsars from the radio signal data."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"import pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport sklearn.metrics as metrics\n\n# Set up code checking\nfrom learntools.core import binder\nbinder.bind(globals())\nfrom learntools.machine_learning.ex8 import *\nprint(\"Setup complete\")"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"Load in the data and check out the first few rows to get acquainted with the features."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"pulsar_data = pd.read_csv('../input/predicting-a-pulsar-star/pulsar_stars.csv')\npulsar_data.head()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"As normal, split the data into training and test sets."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"y = pulsar_data['target_class']\nX = pulsar_data.drop('target_class', axis=1)\ntrain_X, val_X, train_y, val_y = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=1, test_size=.2)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"## 1.
