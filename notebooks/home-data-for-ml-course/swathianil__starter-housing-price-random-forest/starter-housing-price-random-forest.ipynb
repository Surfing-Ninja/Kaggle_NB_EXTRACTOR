It uses the ensemble learning method, which is a technique that combines predictions from several machine learning algorithms to make a predition, enabling it t make more accurate predtions than a single model.\n\n    - For this, a Random Forest constructs several decision trees during model training, and uses the result from all these trees to generate a strong prediction. This is a very powerful method, however with a caveat. Overfitting can easily occur in a Random Forest model. It is advantageos to test outputs from several values of tree depth to determine the optimal tree depth. Mean absolute error is a useful metric to do this. \n\n![alt text for screen readers](https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/rand-forest-2.jpg \"Credits: kdnuggets.com\")\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='9'></a>\n<span style=\"color:pink;font-weight:600;font-size:25px;font-style:serif\">\n    Random Forest Regressor\n</span>\n\n[Top](#21)\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Define a random forest model\nrf_model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=0)\nrf_model.fit(X_train_encoded_scaled, y_train)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-10-17T08:57:35.127121Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-10-17T08:57:35.127995Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-10-17T08:57:37.291455Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-10-17T08:57:35.12795Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-10-17T08:57:37.290482Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='10'></a>\n<span style=\"color:pink;font-weight:600;font-size:20px;font-style:serif\">\n    Performance evaluation\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"color:grey;font-weight:500;font-size:20px;font-style:serif\">\n    Now that we have our model, it is important to do a basic evaluation, to see how our model is performing.
