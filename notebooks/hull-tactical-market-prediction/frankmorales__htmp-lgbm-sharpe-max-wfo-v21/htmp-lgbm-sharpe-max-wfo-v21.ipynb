Instead, it's determined by a practical rule-of-thumb involving the model's complexity and your hardware's speed.\n\nIn the context of our Kaggle submission, the critical \"formula\" must follow is the **Training Time vs. Estimator Count Rule**:\n\n## ⏰ Time Optimization Formula\n\nTraining time for boosting models like LightGBM scales roughly linearly with the number of estimators ($\\text{n\\_estimators}$) and the amount of data.\n\n$$\\text{Time}_{\\text{Training}} \\approx k \\times \\text{n\\_estimators} \\times N_{\\text{samples}}$$\n\nWhere:\n* **$\\text{Time}_{\\text{Training}}$:** The time taken for Phase I (must be $\\mathbf{\\leq 900 \\text{ seconds}}$).\n* **$k$**: A constant related to your hardware speed and the complexity of your features and depth.\n* **$\\text{n\\_estimators}$**: The number of trees (your tuning parameter).\n* **$N_{\\text{samples}}$**: The number of training rows (fixed at 6,000 in your code).\n\n### Your Safety Rule\n\nBased on your executions, the constraint is:\n\n$$\\text{n\\_estimators} \\le 300$$\n\n* **$\\text{n\\_estimators} = 300$**: Consumed $\\approx 900$ seconds, putting you right at the edge of the time limit.\n* **$\\text{n\\_estimators} = 990$**: Caused the time limit to be exceeded, leading to submission failure.\n\nTo ensure a valid submission, you should stick to $\\text{n\\_estimators} = 300$ as the maximum stable value.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Not exactly. The model was trained on $\\mathbf{6,000}$ rows of data, which corresponds to approximately $\\mathbf{16.43}$ calendar years, but represents close to **24 years of trading data**.\n\nHere's the breakdown of why the larger number of years is more relevant for the trading competition:\n\n---\n\n## 📅 Trading vs. Calendar Years\n\nWhen modelling financial data, the number of **trading days** is the standard measure, as it represents the number of independent data points (daily decisions) the model learns from.\n\n* **Calendar Years:** $\\frac{6,000 \\text{ days}}{365.25 \\text{ days/year}} \\approx \\mathbf{16.43 \\text{ calendar years}}$\n* **Trading Years:** $\\frac{6,000 \\text{ days}}{252 \\text{ trading days/year}} \\approx \\mathbf{23.81 \\text{ trading years}}$\n\nThe `df_train.tail(6000)` command selects the last 6,000 **trading days** present in the file. Therefore, the LightGBM model was effectively trained on a dataset spanning nearly **24 years of market history**.\n\nThis large window (24 years) is used to capture sufficient **market regime diversity** (including multiple economic cycles and recessions) to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data during the forecasting phase.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Complete final solution, which is split into two cells: the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Cell** and the **Main Code Cell (LGBM-Dominant Ensemble)**. This structure maximizes code stability and time efficiency for your final submission.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Code Cell 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nThis cell performs initial data investigation and generates visualizations critical for understanding the nature of the target variable ($\\text{market\\_forward\\_excess\\_returns}$).\n\n* **Purpose:** To visually confirm that the data is prepared correctly, identify key distributional properties, and spot highly correlated features before training the model.\n* **Charts Generated:**\n    1.  **Distribution of Returns:** A histogram with a Kernel Density Estimate ($\\text{KDE}$) shows how often different return values occur. In finance, this typically confirms that returns are centered near zero but have \"fat tails,\" indicating rare, extreme events (volatility).\n    2.  **Time Series of Returns:** Plots the last 2000 days of returns against time. This helps identify market regimes, trends, and periods of high/low volatility clustering, which is essential context for the $\\text{LGBM}$ model.\n    3.  **Top Correlated Features:** A bar plot shows the top 10 features with the highest **absolute Spearman correlation** to the target. This identifies features most linearly and non-linearly related to the prediction goal, informing why the $\\text{LGBM}$ model might find a strong signal.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Code Cell 2: Main Model Training and Inference\n\nThis cell contains the **LGBM-Dominant Ensemble**, which is the final, time-optimized prediction system.\n\n### Phase I: Model Training (LGBM)\n\nThe goal here is to train the most stable model possible within the strict 900-second time limit.\n\n* **Data Prep and Feature Set (Lines 63-75):** The script loads data, identifies $\\mathbf{86}$ available features, converts columns, and focuses training on the most recent $\\mathbf{6,000}$ rows for relevance.\n* **Time Optimization (WFO Principle) (Lines 80-92):** The hyperparameters are manually tuned for generalization, mimicking the stability required by Walk Forward Optimization (WFO), which is crucial for a financial model:\n    * **$\\text{n\\_estimators}=300$**: This is the **maximum safe value** that fits within the $\\approx 900$-second time limit.\n    * **$\\text{learning\\_rate}=0.03$ and $\\text{max\\_depth}=7$**: These conservative settings prevent the model from overfitting the training data's noise, which is necessary to achieve a high score on unseen test data.\n* **Metric Report (Lines 95-99):** The script reports its training success:\n    * $\\text{Training R}^2$: **$0.5146$**. The $\\text{LGBM}$ successfully explains over half the variance in the training data, confirming its strong predictive power.\n* **Asset Management (Lines 101-104):** The trained $\\text{LGBM}$ model is saved to disk. All logic related to the unstable $\\text{CNN-LSTM}$ model is deliberately excluded, ensuring the script avoids the fatal $\\text{IO}$ error during inference.\n\n### Phase II: Submission Inference (The Prediction Loop)\n\nThe `predict(test: pl.DataFrame)` function executes every time the competition server requests a prediction.\n\n| Code Section | Model Component | Weights | Rationale |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Model Loading** | **LGBM** | N/A | Uses a **lazy loading** block to load the $\\text{LGBM}$ model *only* on the first call, avoiding the startup timeout risk. |\n| **Component A** | $\\text{LGBM Prediction}$ | $\\mathbf{0.8}$ | The primary prediction is generated by the highly optimized $\\text{LGBM}$ model, based on your historical best scores. |\n| **Component C** | $\\text{Linear Proxy (M1)}$ | $\\mathbf{0.2}$ | A simple prediction based on the $\\text{M1}$ momentum feature provides a stable baseline floor to the ensemble. |\n| **Blending** | $\\text{Raw Prediction}$ | $1.0$ | The predictions are summed by their weights. The $\\text{LSTM}$ component's weight is $\\mathbf{0.0}$ (disabled). |\n| **Final Allocation** | $\\text{Scaling/Clipping}$ | $\\mathbf{0.55}$ | The raw prediction is multiplied by $\\mathbf{0.55}$. This **Sharpe-optimizing scaling factor** controls the portfolio's exposure to volatility (risk) while maximizing the potential for a high return.
