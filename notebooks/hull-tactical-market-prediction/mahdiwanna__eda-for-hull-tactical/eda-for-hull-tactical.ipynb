Distribution of Target (Histogram + KDE) \n\n* The distribution of S&P 500 forward excess returns is roughly bell-shaped but exhibits pronounced fat tails (leptokurtic), indicating that extreme positive and negative returns occur much more frequently than a normal distribution would predict. \n* While the central peak suggests most returns cluster near zero, the heavy tails reflect heightened risk of outsized market moves. There is a slight rightward skew, meaning large positive excess returns may be somewhat more probable or larger than negative ones, although the overall asymmetry is modest. \n* This shape is consistent with well-documented characteristics of financial returns: non-normality, excess kurtosis, and the presence of tail risk.\n\n## Target Over Time (Time Series Plot)\n* The time series of excess returns displays clear episodes of high and low volatility, demonstrating classic volatility clustering—where tranquil periods are punctuated by bursts of intense fluctuation. \n* This heteroskedastic behavior is widely observed in financial markets and motivates the use of models like GARCH or various volatility-adjusted forecasting techniques that dynamically respond to changing risk conditions. Notably, there’s no sustained long-term drift in the series; excess returns oscillate around zero, suggesting the process is stationary and in line with the efficient market hypothesis, where no persistent predictability or bias in returns is evident.\n\nThese features, fat tails, volatility clustering, and mean-reversion—should be carefully considered when selecting and validating predictive models for financial time series.

Data points hugging the diagonal line indicate normality, while systematic deviations reveal departures such as skewness or heavy tails. In our case, the plot showed moderate deviations from normality, especially in the tails, signaling that extreme positive or negative returns occur more frequently than a Gaussian would predict.\n\nThe skewness value of approximately -0.18 indicates a slight asymmetry with a longer left tail, implying that negative returns, though infrequent, can be more extreme than positive returns. This aligns with the commonly observed phenomenon of downside risk in financial markets.\n\nThe kurtosis of about 2.24, marginally below the normal value of 3, suggests the distribution is relatively platykurtic — somewhat flatter and thinner-tailed than normal. This unique characteristic might reflect the specific dataset or time period analyzed, but still highlights that the simple normality assumption does not hold perfectly.\n\n**Why is this important?**\n\n* **Risk Assessment**: Understanding the presence of skewness and kurtosis helps quantify the likelihood of extreme losses or gains (tail risk), which is critical for setting stop-loss limits, stress testing, and capital allocation.\n\n* **Modeling Strategy**: Non-normality means classical models that assume Gaussian errors (e.g., OLS regression) may yield misleading inference and predictions. Robust or distribution-aware methods such as quantile regression, heavy-tailed distributions, or non-parametric approaches are recommended.\n\n* **Portfolio Optimization**: Incorporating skewness and kurtosis metrics can improve portfolio construction rules by accounting for asymmetric risk preferences and tail dependence.\n\n* **Performance Evaluation**: Return distributions influence the reliability of standard metrics like Sharpe ratio; alternative measures that consider higher moments (e.g., Sortino ratio) become more meaningful.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Tail Risk Measures: Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sorted_returns = np.sort(train_df[returns_col])\nvar_95 = np.percentile(sorted_returns, 5)\ncvar_95 = sorted_returns[sorted_returns <= var_95].mean()\nvar_95, cvar_95\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-10-07T18:19:17.653926Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-10-07T18:19:17.654463Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-10-07T18:19:17.672079Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-10-07T18:19:17.654439Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-10-07T18:19:17.670607Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To quantify the risk of extreme negative returns, we computed two key tail risk metrics at the 95% confidence level:\n\n* Value at Risk (VaR 95%): -1.77%\nThis means that, based on historical data, 95% of daily returns are better than -1.77%. Conversely, there is a 5% chance on any given day that returns will be worse than -1.77%. VaR provides a threshold for the worst expected loss under normal market conditions.\n\n* Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR 95%): -2.54%\nCVaR, also known as Expected Shortfall, measures the average loss on the worst 5% of days. In this dataset, if a loss exceeds the VaR threshold, the average loss is -2.54%. CVaR is a more comprehensive measure of tail risk, as it accounts for the magnitude of extreme losses beyond the VaR cutoff.\n\n\n## Why These Measures Matter\n* Risk Management: VaR and CVaR are widely used in finance to set risk limits, allocate capital, and design hedging strategies. They help quantify the potential for rare but severe losses that can threaten portfolio stability.\n\n* Modeling Implications: The presence of significant tail risk (as shown by the gap between VaR and CVaR) highlights the limitations of models that assume normality or focus only on volatility. Models and strategies should be robust to rare, extreme events.\n\n* Portfolio Construction: Understanding tail risk is crucial for stress testing, scenario analysis, and for investors with capital preservation mandates. It informs decisions on leverage, stop-losses, and diversification.\n\n## Practical Use\n* Set risk limits: Use VaR and CVaR to define maximum acceptable daily losses.\n  \n* Stress test strategies: Simulate how portfolios would perform under repeated tail events.\n\n  \n* Communicate risk: These measures provide clear, quantitative risk metrics for stakeholders and regulators.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Baseline Linear Models","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\n\n# Impute missing values with the mean of each column\nimputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')\nX_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(train_df[feature_cols])\n\n# Proceed as before\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_imputed, train_df[target], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\nlr_multi = LinearRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_pred = lr_multi.predict(X_test)\nprint(\"R²:\", r2_score(y_test, y_pred))\nprint(\"MSE:\", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))\nprint(\"MAE:\", mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred))\n\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-10-07T18:39:46.547866Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-10-07T18:39:46.54821Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-10-07T18:39:46.690986Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-10-07T18:39:46.548188Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-10-07T18:39:46.689745Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The baseline linear regression model yielded a negative R² (-0.013), indicating that the model's predictions are less accurate than simply using the mean of the target variable.
