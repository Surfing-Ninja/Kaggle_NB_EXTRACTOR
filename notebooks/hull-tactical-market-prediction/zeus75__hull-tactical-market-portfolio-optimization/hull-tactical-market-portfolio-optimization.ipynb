The goal is to maximize a specific utility function or financial metric, such as the **Adjusted Sharpe Ratio**, subject to predefined constraints on the allocation size and risk.\n\nThe notebook defines the position as the allocation to the risky asset, where:\n* 0.0 MIN POSITION represents 0% in the market (i.e., 100% in the risk-free asset).\n* 1.0 represents 100% in the market (market neutral).\n* 2.0 MAX POSITION represents 200% in the market (a leveraged, aggressive position).\n\nThe overall portfolio return is calculated based on this position:\nStrategy Return = (Risk-Free Rate * (1 - Position)) + (Position * Market Return)\n\nThe optimization itself is performed using numerical methods like **L-BFGS-B** (for Mean-Variance) and **SLSQP** (for constrained and Sharpe maximization problems) via the `scipy.optimize.minimize` function.\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Role in the Hull Tactical Market Prediction Competition\n\nThe central role of portfolio optimization in this competition is to achieve a trading strategy that **outperforms a simple buy-and-hold strategy** while adhering to a critical risk constraint:\n\n### 1. Primary Objective: Maximizing the Adjusted Sharpe Ratio\nThe ultimate goal of the competition is to develop a strategy that yields the highest **Adjusted Sharpe Ratio**. The strategies (Mean-Variance, Minimum Variance, Sharpe Maximization, Risk Parity, CAPM Alpha Signal) all aim to find a series of daily positions that maximize this specific metric. The strategy that produces the highest Adjusted Sharpe Ratio on the historical data is declared the **Winner**.\n\n### 2. Managing Volatility and Returns (The Adjusted Sharpe Penalties)\nThe Adjusted Sharpe Ratio is the competition's core evaluation metric because it heavily **penalizes** strategies that violate two key constraints:\n\n* **Excess Volatility Penalty**: This penalty is applied if the strategy's volatility is greater than **120% of the market's volatility**. \n* **Return Penalty**: This penalty is applied if the strategy's geometric mean excess return **underperforms the market's return**. \nBy optimizing directly for this metric (as in the **Sharpe Maximization** strategy), the portfolio optimization implicitly manages these constraints to secure the highest possible rank.\n\nThe optimization process uses a **lookback window of 180 days** of historical data for all calculations, simulating the rolling window approach typically used in live trading. The final winning strategy is chosen as the one that yields the highest **Adjusted Sharpe Ratio** during this historical evaluation.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Multiple Strategy Implementation**\n\nInstead of a single optimization approach, we implement 6 distinct portfolio optimization strategies:\n\n* Mean-Variance Optimization (Markowitz)\n* Minimum Variance Portfolio\n* Sharpe Ratio Maximization\n* Risk Parity (Inverse Volatility) Allocation\n* CAPM Alpha-based Signal Strategy\n* Sortino Ratio Maximization","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd \nimport polars as pl\nimport hashlib\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize, Bounds\nfrom scipy.stats import skew, kurtosis\nimport warnings\nimport os\nimport kaggle_evaluation.default_inference_server \nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-10-24T05:06:06.304204Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-10-24T05:06:06.304592Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-10-24T05:06:10.546345Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-10-24T05:06:06.304564Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-10-24T05:06:10.545027Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# ============================================================================\n# CONSTANTS AND CONFIGURATION\n# ============================================================================\n\n# Position represents the allocation to the risky asset (the market)\nMIN_POSITION = 0.0  # Minimum investment (0% in market, 100% in risk-free) - Defensive/Conservative\nMAX_POSITION = 2.0  # Maximum investment (200% in market - leveraged) - Aggressive/Leveraged\nTRADING_DAYS_PER_YEAR = 252 # Standard assumption for annualized calculations\nLOOKBACK_WINDOW = 180  # Days of historical data to use for portfolio optimization (rolling window)\nEPS = 1e-10  # Small epsilon to avoid division by zero\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The `calculate_adjusted_sharpe` function, is the core evaluation metric for the competition.
