All suggestions welcome. \n***The complete code is available to run as is!!***","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1. Player Characteristics Features\n***Position/Role Encoding:*** Different positions have fundamentally different movement patterns. Example: WRs run complex routes, OLs move linearly, QBs drop back\n\n***Physical Attributes:*** Size and weight affect acceleration, agility, and role Example: Larger players (OL/DL) have different movement capabilities than smaller players (WR/DB)\n\n***Experience/Team:*** More experienced players might make smarter decisions\n\n***Football Intelligence:***\n- A WR running a \"go\" route vs a CB in \"man coverage\" have predictable interaction patterns\n\n- Passer vs Targeted Receiver vs Other Route Runner have completely different objectives\n\n### 2. Movement & Physics-Based Features\n\n***Critical Movement Metrics***\n\n     - Speed (s): Current velocity magnitude\n     - Acceleration (a): Rate of speed change - indicates cuts/stops/starts\n     - Orientation (o): Which way player is facing\n     - Direction (dir): Actual movement direction\n\n***Advanced Physics Features***\n\n     - Velocity components - Breakdown movement vectors ( helps models understand movement in field coordinates) \n     - Trignometric encoding (prevents 0° vs 360° discontinuity issues)\n\n### 3. Play Context Features - Most Important\n\nThese features are Game Changing!!!\n\n***Ball Landing position***\n\n        - The spot tells you where the play is designed to go\n        - Receivers will adjust routes towards the ball\n        - Defenders will react to the ball location\n        - Distance to ball predicts engagement likelihoo\n\n***Field Position Intelligence***\n\n        - Red Zone (inside 20) - Compressed field, different route concepts\n        - Mid-Field: more vertical routes\n        - Backed-up: conservative play calling \n\n### 4.  Relative Features (Player Interactions)\n\n***Defensive Pressure Metrics***\n\n        - Receiver separation: Critical for completion probability\n        - Pass rush pressure: Affects QB movement and timing\n        - Zone coverage voids: Areas where receivers can find space\n\nFootball is a game of spatial relationships. Leverage (inside/outside positioning) determines route success. Cushion (DB-WR distance) affects route development\n\n### 5. Advanced Football Intelligence\n\n***Route & Coverage Concepts***\n\n      **Role Based Behavior**\n      \n          - Targeted Receiver: Primary read, most likely to adjust route\n          - Other Route Runners: Clear out defenders, run decoy routes\n          - Passer: Follow-through, scramble, or avoid pressure\n          - Defensive Coverage: Maintain leverage, react to receivers\n\n    \n     **Field Awareness**\n\n          - Sideline: Acts as extra defender, limits route options\n          - End zone: Compresses field, affects route depth\n\n    **Formation Intelligence**\n\n          - Spread formation: More vertical routes, wider spacing\n          - Bunched formation: Pick plays, crossing routes\n          - Empty backfield: Passing tendency\n\n### 6. Temoral Features\n\n***Movement History***\n\n    - Acceleration trends - Is player speeding up/slowing down?\n    - Direction changes: Route breaks, cuts, adjustments\n    - Historical positions: Route running patterns","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport pickle\nimport json\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n# Set up plotting style\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8')\nsns.set_palette(\"husl\")\n\n# =============================================================================\n# DATA MANAGER FOR PERSISTENCE\n# =============================================================================\n\nclass NFLDataManager:\n    def __init__(self, base_path=\"outputs/working/\"):\n        self.base_path = Path(base_path)\n        self.features_path = self.base_path / \"features\"\n        self.models_path = self.base_path / \"models\"\n        self.metadata_path = self.base_path / \"metadata\"\n        self.eda_path = self.base_path / \"eda\"\n        \n        #
