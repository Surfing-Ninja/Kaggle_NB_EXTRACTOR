I’m planing to build an **agnostic visualization library** in plain ***Python*** and ***Matplotlib*** with *pip-installable* and prolly it may be useful to extend for each year’s competition goal. \n\nSince many elements stay consistent. This will be a first version; my goal is to release it by the end of the competition or before deadline (no promises, but I’ll try) while I focus on this year’s task. The aim is to make it available to everyone so they can ramp up faster on the competition goals in future\n\n<img src=\"https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F8412510%2F0541fbf83c33aa09cbf8c80cbb8edf07%2Fanimation.gif?generation=1762312138020475&alt=media\" alt=\"Description of image\" class=\"rounded-image\" \n     style=\"border: 2px solid black; border-radius: 12px;\">\n\n<center><i>Figure 1.1</i> - Viz Without Defense Strength</center>\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F8412510%2Fd130be4319cd7fa43718295856aea8d7%2Fanimation.gif?generation=1762315186164728&alt=media\" alt=\"Description of image\" class=\"rounded-image\" \n     style=\"border: 2px solid black; border-radius: 12px;\">\n\n<center><i>Figure 1.2</i> - Viz With Defense Strength</center>\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F8412510%2F62615525091180f13196675f7146b3e0%2Fanimation.gif?generation=1762316568331371&alt=media\" alt=\"Description of image\" class=\"rounded-image\" \n     style=\"border: 2px solid black; border-radius: 12px;\">\n\n<center><i>Figure 1.3</i> - A play worth to analyze for this year competition</center>\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\nThanks for taking a look.
