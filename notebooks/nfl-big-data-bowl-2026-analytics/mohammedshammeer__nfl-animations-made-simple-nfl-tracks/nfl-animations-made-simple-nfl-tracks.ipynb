Designed with the NFL Big Data Bowl in mind, it provides a simple interface to plot static plays, generate dynamic animations, and view detailed, context-rich breakdowns of individual plays.\n\n## Key Features\n* Standard Field Visualization: Generate a regulation NFL field with customizable markings.\n* Single Frame Plotting: Visualize player positions at any specific moment in a play.\n* Dynamic Animations: Create smooth, animated GIFs or videos of entire plays.\n* \"Relay\" Dashboard View: A comprehensive visualization that includes:\n  * Live scoreboard with team details and win probabilities.\n  * Highlighted player card with key stats (name, position, height, etc.).\n  * On-field play and game context.\n  * Automatic highlighting of the targeted or predicted player.\n* Kaggle Notebook Compatibility: Easily render animations directly within Kaggle notebooks.\n* Out-of-Bounds Tracking: Players and the ball are visualized even when they go outside the field of play, without distorting the field's proportions.\n\n\n## Installation\nYou can install nfl-tracks using pip:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install nfl_tracks","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-10-15T10:46:25.469887Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-10-15T10:46:25.470211Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-10-15T10:46:32.001981Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-10-15T10:46:25.470154Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-10-15T10:46:32.000746Z"},"_kg_hide-output":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Function Overview\nThe core of the library is the visuals.Play class, which you initialize once for a specific play.
