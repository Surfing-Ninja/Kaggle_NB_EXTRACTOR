The focus is on understanding player behavior and game dynamics through exploratory data analysis (EDA) rather than predictive modeling.\n\nThe analysis combines weekly input and output files into a unified dataset to examine movement patterns, speed distributions, and positional relationships. Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), the notebook investigates how player attributes such as speed, acceleration, and distance to the ball relate to play outcomes.\n\nVisualizations include:\n\n- Speed and acceleration distributions across player positions\n- Distance-to-ball patterns\n- Correlation heatmaps between key performance metrics\n- Scatter plots of speed versus distance covered\n- Player trajectory maps\n\nThe goal is to translate raw tracking data into clear, interpretable insights about player performance and spatial structure in NFL gameplay.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-07T19:41:28.679967Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-07T19:41:28.680699Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-07T19:41:29.82859Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-07T19:41:28.680666Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-07T19:41:29.827751Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Load and explore a single week's data\n\nChoose one pair of input and output files (e.g., week 1) to load into pandas DataFrames and perform initial data exploration.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Define the directory and file names for week 1\ninput_file = '/kaggle/input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2026-analytics/114239_nfl_competition_files_published_analytics_final/train/input_2023_w01.csv'\noutput_file = '/kaggle/input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2026-analytics/114239_nfl_competition_files_published_analytics_final/train/output_2023_w01.csv'\n\n# Load the data into pandas DataFrames\ndf_input = pd.read_csv(input_file)\ndf_output = pd.read_csv(output_file)\n\n# Display the first few rows\nprint(\"Input DataFrame Head:\")\nprint(df_input.head())\n\nprint(\"\\nOutput DataFrame Head:\")\nprint(df_output.head())\n\n# Display summaries\nprint(\"\\nInput DataFrame Info:\")\ndf_input.info()\n\nprint(\"\\nOutput DataFrame Info:\")\ndf_output.info()\n\n# Generate descriptive statistics\nprint(\"\\nInput DataFrame Description:\")\nprint(df_input.describe())\n\nprint(\"\\nOutput DataFrame Description:\")\nprint(df_output.describe())\n\n# Check for missing values\nprint(\"\\nInput DataFrame Missing Values:\")\nprint(df_input.isnull().sum())\n\nprint(\"\\nOutput DataFrame Missing Values:\")\nprint(df_output.isnull().sum())","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-07T19:46:19.304576Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-07T19:46:19.304832Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-07T19:46:20.616886Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-07T19:46:19.304818Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-07T19:46:20.616032Z"},"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Develop a function to load and combine weekly data\n\nCreate a function that takes a week number as input, loads the corresponding input and output files, and combines them into a single DataFrame.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def load_and_merge_week_data(week_num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Loads and merges the input and output data for a given week number.\n\n    Args:\n        week_num: The week number (integer) to load.\n\n    Returns:\n        A pandas DataFrame containing the merged data, or None if files are not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    base_dir = '/kaggle/input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2026-analytics/114239_nfl_competition_files_published_analytics_final/train'\n    week_str = f\"{week_num:02d}\"\n    input_file = os.path.join(base_dir, f'input_2023_w{week_str}.csv')\n    output_file = os.path.join(base_dir, f'output_2023_w{week_str}.csv')\n\n    if not os.path.exists(input_file):\n        print(f\"Input file not found: {input_file}\")\n        return None\n    if not os.path.exists(output_file):\n        print(f\"Output file not found: {output_file}\")\n        return None\n\n    df_input = pd.read_csv(input_file)\n    df_output = pd.read_csv(output_file)\n\n    #
