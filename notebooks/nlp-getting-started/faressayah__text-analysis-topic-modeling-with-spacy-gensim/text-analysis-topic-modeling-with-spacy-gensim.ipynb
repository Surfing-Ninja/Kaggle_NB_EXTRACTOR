Python NLP framework such as Gensim, NLTK, and spaCy makes it easier to do this.\n\n> The purpose of this article is to guide one through the whole process of topic modeling right from pre-processing your raw textual data, creating your topic models, evaluating the topic models, to visualizing them. The python packages used during the tutorial will be spaCy (for pre-processing), Gensim (for topic modeling), and pyLDAvis (for visualization).\n\n# 📌 Notebook Goals\n> - Learn how to use the power of `spaCy` to clean textual data.\n> - Use different Topic Modelling techniques like `LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)`, `LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing)`, and `HDP (Hierarchical Drichlet Process)`\n---\n\n# 📚 Topic Modelling Overview\nLet's understand the general concept of Topic Modelling and why it's important! \n> - Topic Modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique that allows us to efficiently analyze large volumes of text by clustering documents into topics.\n> - A large amount of text data is unlabeled meaning we can’t apply Supervised Learning approaches to create machine learning models for the data! In this case of text data, this means attempting to discover clusters of documents, grouped by topic. A very important idea to keep in mind here is that we don’t know the correct topic or the right answer! All we know is that the documents clustered together share similar topic ideas. It is up to us to identify what these topics represent.\n\n---\n# 📑 Text Analysis Tutorial\n\n> Our steps, naturally, are setting up our imports. We will be using spaCy for data pre-processing and computational linguistics, Gensim for Topic Modeling, Scikit-Learn for classification, and Keras for text generation.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# ✔️ Import Libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport spacy \nfrom spacy import displacy\n\nimport gensim\nfrom gensim.corpora import Dictionary\nfrom gensim.models import LdaModel, CoherenceModel, LsiModel, HdpModel\nfrom gensim.models.wrappers import LdaMallet\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport sklearn\nimport keras\n\nimport warnings\n\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=DeprecationWarning)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-02-16T22:13:16.621379Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-02-16T22:13:16.621844Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-02-16T22:13:23.866573Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-02-16T22:13:16.621747Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-02-16T22:13:23.865659Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(spacy.__version__)\nprint(gensim.__version__)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-02-16T22:13:23.868459Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-02-16T22:13:23.869055Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-02-16T22:13:23.875877Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-02-16T22:13:23.869008Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-02-16T22:13:23.874701Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n# 📂 Gathering Data\n\n> The dataset we will be working with will be the Lee corpus which is a shortened of the Lee Background Corpus, and the 20NG dataset.
