Models can't \"memorize\" repeated records, ensuring fair validation.\n\n#### Step 2: Combine for Uniform Processing 🔗\n\nTrain and test are temporarily combined so encodings, transforms, and scalers remain identical. This ensures consistent numeric and categorical representations across all data.\n\n#### Step 3: Minimal Label Encoding of Categoricals 🔤\n\nAll categorical (object) columns are label-encoded. Keeps numeric codes aligned between train/test, prevents model confusion, and reduces the risk of unseen categories during scoring.\n\n#### Step 4: Smart Feature Selection 🌟\n\nOnly keep a couple of low-cardinality, interpretable categorical variables.\nRank all numeric features by predictive power (mutual information).\nLimit the feature space to just 5–6 most informative numerics, discarding the rest.\n\n#### Step 5: Clean Numeric Interactions ➕➗✖️\n\nFor the top numerics, create key interactions (sum, product, ratio).\nAvoid unnecessary or noisy feature combinations.\nEach interaction reflects a real-world relationship (e.g., debt-to-income ratio).\n\n#### Step 6: Mathematical Transformations & Binning 🧮\n\nApply quantile binning, log1p, and sqrt to top numerics.\nThese steps reduce skew, highlight nonlinear thresholds, and improve generalization.\n\n#### Step 7: Split Back to Train/Test 📋\n\nSafety first: after all shared transformations, restore strict train/test boundaries, avoiding leakage.\n\n#### Step 8: Optional Standard Scaling 📏\n\nScale core numerics for compatibility with linear/meta models.\nTrees are robust to scaling, but stackers and validation benefit.\n\n#### What’s NOT Included\n❌ No groupby aggregate features (models and feature selectors already find global/local patterns).\n\n❌ No hundreds of random interactions.\n\n❌ No variance threshold filtering—you have already removed constants and highly correlated features with smarter selectors.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import mutual_info_classif\n\nTARGET = 'loan_paid_back'\n\n# 1.

This step evaluates all models side-by-side using multiple metrics and visualizations, then compares your stacked model against simpler alternatives to confirm the extra complexity was worth it.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Evaluate All Models**\n\nCalculate AUC, accuracy, F1, precision, recall, specificity, and optimal thresholds for each Level 0 model and the final meta-model. This shows not just \"which predicts well\" but **how well each performs across different decision thresholds and metrics**.\n\n***\n\n## **Step 2: Rank Models by AUC**\n\nSort all models by their ROC-AUC score. Example: CatBoost (0.9523) > LGB (0.9456) > XGB (0.9412) > ... > Naive Bayes (0.8956). Identifies which base models are strongest and whether the meta-model beats them all.\n\n***\n\n## **Step 3: Visualize ROC Curves**\n\nPlot ROC curves for all 10 models (9 Level 0 + 1 meta). Higher curves closer to top-left = better discrimination. **Key insight:** If meta-model's curve is above all Level 0 curves, stacking worked. If it's below, simpler averaging might be better.\n\n***\n\n## **Step 4: Plot Calibration Curves**\n\nShow whether predicted probabilities match actual default rates. A perfect model's calibration curve follows the diagonal (45°). Miscalibrated models predict 0.7 but 60% actually default. Meta-model often has better calibration (more honest probabilities) than base models.\n\n***\n\n## **Step 5: Compare Prediction Distributions**\n\nHistogram of predicted probabilities for each model. Some models might be overconfident (clustered near 0 and 1), others too cautious (clustered near 0.5). Meta-model often has a balanced, realistic distribution.\n\n***\n\n## **Step 6: Compare Against Greedy Ensemble**\n\nGreedy forward selection: Start with nothing, iteratively add the model that improves ensemble AUC the most. Example result: \"Best ensemble = LGB + Cat + XGB (AUC = 0.9487)\". **Compare:** Is meta-model (0.9523) better than simple greedy average (0.9487)? If yes, stacking justified. If no, use greedy ensemble instead.\n\n***\n\n## **Result:**\n\nClear ranking of all models, visual proof that meta-model outperforms alternatives, and confirmation that two-layer stacking was worth the effort. You now have confidence in your final submission.\n\n***\n\n**This evaluation ensures your most complex model actually performs better—and isn't just overfitting complexity.**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.metrics import (\n    roc_auc_score, accuracy_score, f1_score, precision_score, recall_score, brier_score_loss, roc_curve\n)\nfrom sklearn.calibration import calibration_curve\n\nclass Step6_ModelEvaluation:\n    def __init__(self, target_col='loan_paid_back'):\n        self.target_col = target_col\n\n    def evaluate_all_models(self, y_true, predictions_dict, model_type=\"Level 0\"):\n        results = {}\n        for name, preds in predictions_dict.items():\n            preds_binary = (preds > 0.5).astype(int)\n            auc = roc_auc_score(y_true, preds)\n            acc = accuracy_score(y_true, preds_binary)\n            f1 = f1_score(y_true, preds_binary)\n            prec = precision_score(y_true, preds_binary)\n            recall = recall_score(y_true, preds_binary)\n            brier = brier_score_loss(y_true, preds)\n            results[name] = {'auc': auc, 'accuracy': acc, 'f1': f1, 'precision': prec, 'recall': recall, 'brier': brier}\n            print(f\"[{model_type}] {name}: AUC={auc:.4f} | Acc={acc:.4f} | F1={f1:.4f} | Prec={prec:.4f} | Recall={recall:.4f} | Brier={brier:.4f}\")\n        return results\n\n    def model_rank_table(self, results):\n        res_df = pd.DataFrame(results).T\n        print(res_df.sort_values('auc', ascending=False)[['auc', 'accuracy', 'f1', 'precision', 'recall', 'brier']])\n\n    def plot_roc_curves(self, y_true, predictions_dict):\n        plt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\n        for name, preds in predictions_dict.items():\n            fpr, tpr, _ = roc_curve(y_true, preds)\n            auc = roc_auc_score(y_true, preds)\n            plt.plot(fpr, tpr, label=f\"{name} (AUC: {auc:.3f})\")\n        plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='gray', linestyle='--')\n        plt.xlabel(\"False Positive Rate\");
