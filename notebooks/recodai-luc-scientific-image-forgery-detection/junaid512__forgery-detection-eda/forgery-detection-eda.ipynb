1st Graph Analysis & Key Findings:\n\nThe dataset shows a strong concentration of aspect ratios between 1.0-1.5 (nearly square to slightly landscape)\nA significant secondary peak appears around 6-7, representing narrow portrait-oriented images\nMinor peaks at 10-12 suggest some extremely narrow images (possibly Western blots or gel electrophoresis)\nThe distribution is highly right-skewed, with most images clustered in the lower range\nStrategic Implications for Modeling:\n\nA dynamic resizing strategy is required rather than fixed dimensions\nThe 1.0-1.5 aspect ratio cluster (majority of images) should inform the default input size\nSpecial handling may be needed for extreme aspect ratios (6+, 10+)\nTiling approach will be essential for images with dimensions exceeding typical model limits\n\n### Analysis & Key Findings:\n\nBimodal distribution with primary peak at 500-1,000 pixels and secondary peak at 2,000-4,000 pixels\nMaximum dimensions reach ~4,000 pixels in width and height\nHeight distribution is slightly more concentrated at the lower end compared to width\nThe dataset contains significant variation in image sizes with no uniform standard\nStrategic Implications for Modeling:\n\nMulti-scale processing is essential to handle the wide range of dimensions\nImages in the 500-1,500 pixel range (70% of dataset) can be processed with standard models\nLarge images (>2,000 pixels) should be divided into tiles with appropriate overlap\nA dynamic batching strategy will be needed to maximize GPU utilization while avoiding memory issues\nAspect ratio preservation during resizing is critical to avoid distorting forensic features\n4.3 Preprocessing Strategy Recommendations\nBased on these dimension characteristics, the following preprocessing approach is recommended:\n\nTiered Processing Strategy:\nSmall images (500-1,500px): Process at full resolution\nMedium images (1,500-2,500px): Resize to 1,500px on the longest side\nLarge images (>2,500px): Implement tiling with 20% overlap\nDynamic Batching:\nGroup images by size ranges to minimize wasted computation\nUse adaptive padding within batches rather than global resizing\nModel Architecture Considerations:\nImplement feature pyramid networks to handle multi-scale features\nUse context-aware pooling to maintain spatial relationships\nConsider U-Net variants with adjustable input

Sensitivity Requirements:\n\nModels must detect regions as small as 0.028% of the image (e.g., 50x50 pixels in a 2000x2000 image)\nFalse negatives on micro-forgery detection would render the model ineffective for scientific integrity\n2. Performance Tradeoffs:\n\nStandard segmentation architectures may overlook these tiny regions due to downsampling\nRequires specialized attention mechanisms or high-resolution processing\nThe 2.1% median means standard 256x256 models would see only 5x5 pixel regions\n3. Evaluation Metric Focus:\n\nStandard IoU metrics would be inadequate (10x10 forgery in 1000x1000 = 0.1% IoU)\nMust prioritize detection recall at extremely low coverage thresholds\nThe competition's F1 variant should be weighted toward small-region performance\n5.3 Recommended Detection Strategy\n1. Multi-Resolution Processing:\n\nImplement a pyramid approach with:\nHigh-resolution stream (x1) for micro-forgery detection\nMid-resolution (x0.5) for medium forgeries\nLow-resolution (x0.25) for large forgeries\n2. Region-Specific Model Heads:\n\nTrain separate detection heads for:\nMicro-forgery (<1% coverage)\nStandard forgery (1-10%)\nLarge forgery (>10%)\n3. Specialized Loss Function:\n\nDesign a coverage-weighted loss that:\nIncreases penalty for missing small regions\nUses logarithmic scaling for the 0.01-5% range\nIncorporates region count as a secondary signal\n4. Data Augmentation Focus:\n\nGenerate synthetic micro-forgery examples by:\nCopy-pasting tiny regions (5-50 pixels)\nAdding subtle rotation/scale variations\nBlending edges to mimic realistic forgeries\nThis analysis confirms that the fundamental challenge is detecting vanishingly small manipulations. A successful model must prioritize sensitivity to minute changes over broad pattern recognition - a direct inversion of typical segmentation tasks where larger regions dominate performance metrics.

Critical Technical Considerations:\n\nImage Type Variability: Different biomedical image types (microscope, blots, gels) have distinct frequency signatures\nProcessing Pipeline: Must handle variable image sizes and aspect ratios without distorting frequency patterns\nComputational Efficiency: Frequency transforms must be optimized for large datasets\n4. Validation Approach:\n\nCompare frequency patterns between authentic and forged images\nMeasure the significance of line artifacts in FFT spectra\nQuantify DCT energy distribution differences between genuine and manipulated regions\nThis frequency-domain analysis reveals that copy-move forgeries leave distinct spectral signatures that can be leveraged as powerful detection features. The linear artifacts visible in the FFT spectrum represent a forensic \"fingerprint\" of the duplication process, providing complementary information to spatial-domain analysis. These patterns would be particularly valuable for detecting the small forgeries that dominate this dataset, as frequency analysis can reveal periodic patterns even in tiny regions that are visually imperceptible.\n\nThe observed patterns confirm that a successful detection system should incorporate both spatial and frequency-domain analysis to achieve optimal performance, as each domain provides complementary forensic evidence. This multi-domain approach is essential for detecting sophisticated forgeries that maintain visual consistency in the spatial domain but leave detectable traces in frequency representations.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def plot_edge_maps(img_path, figsize=(14,5)):\n    img = cv2.imread(img_path)\n    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\n\n    sobelx = cv2.Sobel(gray, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0, ksize=3)\n    sobely = cv2.Sobel(gray, cv2.CV_64F, 0, 1, ksize=3)\n    sobel = cv2.magnitude(sobelx, sobely)\n    laplacian = cv2.Laplacian(gray, cv2.CV_64F)\n    canny = cv2.Canny(gray, 80, 200)\n\n    plt.figure(figsize=figsize)\n    plt.subplot(1,4,1);
