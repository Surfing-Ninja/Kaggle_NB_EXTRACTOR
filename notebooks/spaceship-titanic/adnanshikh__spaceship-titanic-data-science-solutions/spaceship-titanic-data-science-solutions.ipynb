Here, the individual trees are built via bagging (i.e. aggregation of bootstraps which are nothing but multiple train datasets created via sampling with replacement) and split using fewer features. The resulting diverse forest of uncorrelated trees exhibits reduced variance; therefore, is more robust towards change in data and carries its prediction accuracy to new data. It works well with both continuous & categorical data.\n\n**Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM):** LGBM works essentially the same as XGBoost but with a lighter boosting technique. It usually produces similar results to XGBoost but is significantly faster.\n\n**Categorical Boosting (CatBoost):** CatBoost is an open source algorithm based on gradient boosted decision trees.
