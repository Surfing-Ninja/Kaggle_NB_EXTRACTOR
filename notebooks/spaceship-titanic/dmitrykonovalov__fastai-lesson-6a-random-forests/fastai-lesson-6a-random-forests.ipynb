Then we just have to split on codes `<=0` (since `C` is mapped to category `0`). Note that if we wanted to split into \"Q\" in one group, we'd need to use two binary splits, first to separate \"C\" from \"Q\" and \"S\", and then a second split to separate \"Q\" from \"S\". For this reason, sometimes it can still be helpful to use dummy variables for categorical variables with few levels (like this one).\n\nIn practice, I often use dummy variables for <4 levels, and numeric codes for >=4 levels.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## The random forest","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can't make the decision tree much bigger than the example above, since some leaf nodes already have only 50 rows in them. That's not a lot of data to make a prediction.\n\nSo how could we use bigger trees? One big insight came from Leo Breiman: what if we create lots of bigger trees, and take the average of their predictions? Taking the average prediction of a bunch of models in this way is known as [bagging](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00058655).\n\nThe idea is that we want each model's predictions in the averaged ensemble to be uncorrelated with each other model. That way, if we average the predictions, the average will be equal to the true target value -- that's because the average of lots of uncorrelated random errors is zero. That's quite an amazing insight!\n\nOne way we can create a bunch of uncorrelated models is to train each of them on a different random subset of the data.

Our \"OneR\" model, consisting of a single binary split, was nearly as good as our more complex models. Perhaps in practice a simple model like this might be much easier to use, and could be worth considering. Our random forest wasn't an improvement on the single decision tree at all.\n\nSo we should always be careful to benchmark simple models, as see if they're good enough for our needs. In practice, you will often find that simple models will have trouble providing adequate accuracy for more complex tasks, such as recommendation systems, NLP, computer vision, or multivariate time series. But there's no need to guess -- it's so easy to try a few different models, there's no reason not to give the simpler ones a go too!\n\nAnother thing I think we can take away is that random forests aren't actually that complicated at all. We were able to implement the key features of them in a notebook quite quickly. And they aren't sensitive to issues like normalization, interactions, or non-linear transformations, which make them extremely easy to work with, and hard to mess up!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"If you found this notebook useful, please remember to click the little up-arrow at the top to upvote it, since I like to know when people have found my work useful, and it helps others find it too.
