These binary features indicate whether a passenger's cabin number falls within specific numerical ranges. Each binary feature corresponds to a different \"cabin region,\" and a value of 1 indicates that the cabin number falls within the specified range, while a value of 0 indicates that it does not.\n\nBy creating these binary features based on the ranges of 'Cabin_number', we've transformed a continuous numerical feature into a set of categorical binary features that capture specific intervals of cabin numbers. This can help our model capture potential relationships or patterns associated with different ranges of cabin numbers and their impact on survival.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_train['Cabin_region1']=(df_train['Cabin_number']<300).astype(int)  \ndf_train['Cabin_region2']=((df_train['Cabin_number']>=300) & (df_train['Cabin_number']<600)).astype(int)\ndf_train['Cabin_region3']=((df_train['Cabin_number']>=600) & (df_train['Cabin_number']<900)).astype(int)\ndf_train['Cabin_region4']=((df_train['Cabin_number']>=900) & (df_train['Cabin_number']<1200)).astype(int)\ndf_train['Cabin_region5']=((df_train['Cabin_number']>=1200) & (df_train['Cabin_number']<1500)).astype(int)\ndf_train['Cabin_region6']=((df_train['Cabin_number']>=1500) & (df_train['Cabin_number']<1800)).astype(int)\ndf_train['Cabin_region7']=(df_train['Cabin_number']>=1800).astype(int)\n\ndf_test['Cabin_region1']=(df_test['Cabin_number']<300).astype(int)  \ndf_test['Cabin_region2']=((df_test['Cabin_number']>=300) & (df_test['Cabin_number']<600)).astype(int)\ndf_test['Cabin_region3']=((df_test['Cabin_number']>=600) & (df_test['Cabin_number']<900)).astype(int)\ndf_test['Cabin_region4']=((df_test['Cabin_number']>=900) & (df_test['Cabin_number']<1200)).astype(int)\ndf_test['Cabin_region5']=((df_test['Cabin_number']>=1200) & (df_test['Cabin_number']<1500)).astype(int)\ndf_test['Cabin_region6']=((df_test['Cabin_number']>=1500) & (df_test['Cabin_number']<1800)).astype(int)\ndf_test['Cabin_region7']=(df_test['Cabin_number']>=1800).astype(int)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-19T16:19:02.915625Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-19T16:19:02.916101Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-19T16:19:02.946862Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-19T16:19:02.916065Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-19T16:19:02.94555Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Visualise distribution of this new features.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_train['Cabin_regions_plot'] = (\n    df_train['Cabin_region1'] +\n    2 * df_train['Cabin_region2'] +\n    3 * df_train['Cabin_region3'] +\n    4 * df_train['Cabin_region4'] +\n    5 * df_train['Cabin_region5'] +\n    6 * df_train['Cabin_region6'] +\n    7 * df_train['Cabin_region7']\n).astype(int)\n\n# Create the plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))\nsns.countplot(data=df_train, x='Cabin_regions_plot', hue='Transported')\n\n# Set title and labels\nplt.title('Count of Passengers in Combined Cabin Regions by Transportation')\nplt.xlabel('Combined Cabin Region')\nplt.ylabel('Count')\n\n# Add legend\nplt.legend(title='Transported', loc='upper right', labels=['Not Transported', 'Transported'])\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n# Drop the temporary column\ndf_train.drop('Cabin_regions_plot', axis=1, inplace=True)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-19T16:19:02.948464Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-19T16:19:02.949262Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-19T16:19:03.400084Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-19T16:19:02.949209Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-19T16:19:03.398783Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Insight:**\n\n* Passengers belonging to Cabin regions 1,3,4 are more likely to be transported.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Extract Features from Name Column**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**The Feature Engineering we gonna perform in Name column are:**\n\n*Surname Extraction:*\n\n* By extracting the surname from the 'Name' column and creating a new 'Surname' feature, you are aiming to capture potential family relationships among passengers.

Simple Imputation: One straightforward method for handling missing values is to replace them with some representative value. For continuous features (numerical), this passage suggests using the median value of the available data, and for categorical features (non-numerical), it suggests using the mode (most frequent value). While this method is easy to implement and can work reasonably well, it might not capture complex relationships in the data and could potentially lead to biased results.\n\n2. Pattern-Based Imputation: To maximize the accuracy of predictive models, it's important to explore patterns within the missing data. This involves investigating the relationships between different features in the dataset and using this information to make more informed imputations. In the context of the example provided (passenger data), the passage suggests looking at joint distributions of features. For instance, it proposes examining whether passengers from the same group (a categorical feature) tend to come from the same family (another categorical feature). This can help identify relationships or dependencies that might guide more accurate imputations.\n\nThe main idea behind pattern-based imputation is that by considering relationships between features, you can potentially make more accurate estimates of missing values. For instance, if passengers from the same group are indeed more likely to come from the same family, you could use this information to impute missing family information based on the group.

is a relationship between the cabin_number and Group columns, and this relationship holds true for each specific deck on the ship. In other words, for each deck, there seems to be a linear correlation between the cabin numbers and the group.\n\nTo leverage this pattern and impute missing cabin_number values, we can perform linear regression separately for each deck. Linear regression is a statistical technique that models the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.\n\nIn this context, we would do the following:\n\nGroup the Data: Group the data by the Cabin_deck column, creating subsets of data for each deck.\n\nWithin-Deck Linear Regression: For each deck's subset of data, perform a linear regression where you predict the cabin_number based on the group_number.\n\nImpute Missing Values: For the rows where cabin_number is missing and belongs to a specific deck, we will use the linear regression equation to estimate and impute a missing cabin_number value based on the corresponding group_number.\n\nBy performing this process for each deck, we are essentially capturing the linear relationship between cabin_number and group_number specific to each deck. This allows you to make reasonable estimations for missing cabin_number values based on the observed pattern within each deck.\n\nKeep in mind that while this approach might provide reasonable estimates for missing values, it's still an approximation and might not be accurate in all cases.
