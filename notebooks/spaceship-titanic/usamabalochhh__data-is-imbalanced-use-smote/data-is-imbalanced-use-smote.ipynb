It is used to obtain a synthetically class-balanced or nearly class-balanced training set, which is then used to train the classifier. The SMOTE samples are linear combinations of two similar samples from the minority class (x and xR) and are defined as \n\n### s=x+u⋅(xR−x),\n\n\nwith 0 ≤ u ≤ 1; xR is randomly chosen among the 5 minority class nearest neighbors of x.\n\n#### **SMOTE does not change the expected value of the (SMOTE-augmented) minority class and it decreases its variability**\n\nSMOTE samples have the same expected value as the original minority class samples (E(Xj^SMOTE)=E(Xj)\n), but smaller variance (var(Xj^SMOTE)=2/3 var(Xj)).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **AFTER APPLYING THIS APPROACH TO MY DATA, MY MODEL IMPROVED** 😎\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### **Import Libraries:**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split,cross_val_score\nimport xgboost as xgb","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-10-16T08:36:08.467838Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-10-16T08:36:08.468373Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-10-16T08:36:09.575252Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-10-16T08:36:08.468258Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-10-16T08:36:09.574316Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_csv = pd.read_csv('../input/tabular-playground-series-aug-2022/train.csv')\ntrain_csv.head(2)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-10-13T15:12:31.658786Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-10-13T15:12:31.659818Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-10-13T15:12:31.885125Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-10-13T15:12:31.659776Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-10-13T15:12:31.883909Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"for col in train_csv.columns:\n    if train_csv.loc[:,col].isnull().sum() > 0:\n        train_csv.loc[:,col].fillna(train_csv.loc[:,col].median(),inplace=True)\n\ntrain_data = train_csv.copy()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-10-13T15:12:36.665005Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-10-13T15:12:36.665876Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-10-13T15:12:36.714829Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-10-13T15:12:36.665825Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-10-13T15:12:36.713605Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# ***Do Read this :***","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"***Like I said on above Explanation that we detected that 0 have too many samples but 1 have too low. so this is imbalancing. if Our Model train on this then it learns the 0 output too much because it contain too many 0, when we try to predict the output which has actual value 0 and it will predict output 0 but when we try to predict the output which has actual value 1 but becasue of too many learning on 0 it will predict that output 0 which is incorrect.*** ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_csv.failure.value_counts()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-10-13T15:12:40.409954Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-10-13T15:12:40.410422Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-10-13T15:12:40.42567Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-10-13T15:12:40.410385Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-10-13T15:12:40.424192Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\nfor col in train_csv.columns:\n    if train_csv.loc[:,col].dtype != 'object':\n        \n        first_quartile = train_csv[col].quantile(0.25)\n        third_quartile = train_csv[col].quantile(0.75)\n        \n        IQR = third_quartile -
