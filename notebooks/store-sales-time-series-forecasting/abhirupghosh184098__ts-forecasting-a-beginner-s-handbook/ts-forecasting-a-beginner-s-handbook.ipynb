I used the [Time Series course on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/time-series) to help me get started, and a lot of the code in this notebook is from that course, which in turn, are inspired by winning solutions from past Kaggle time series forecasting competitions.\n\n## [Evaluation](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/overview/evaluation)\nThe evaluation metric for this competition is Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error.\n\nThe RMSLE is calculated as:\n$[\\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\log (1 + \\hat{y}_i) - \\log (1 + y_i)\\right)^2}]$\nwhere:\n\n𝑛 is the total number of instances,  \n𝑦̂ 𝑖 is the predicted value of the target for instance (i),  \n𝑦𝑖 is the actual value of the target for instance (i), and,  \nlog is the natural logarithm.\n\n## [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/data)\n\n### Training data: train.csv\n\n* The training data, comprising time series of features **store_nbr**, **family**, and **onpromotion** as well as the target **sales**.\n* **store_nbr** identifies the store at which the products are sold.\n* **family** identifies the type of product sold.\n* **sales** gives the total sales for a product family at a particular store at a given date. Fractional values are possible since products can be sold in fractional units (1.5 kg of cheese, for instance, as opposed to 1 bag of chips).\n* **onpromotion** gives the total number of items in a product family that were being promoted at a store at a given date.\n\n\n### Test data: test.csv\n\n* The test data, having the same features as the training data. You will predict the target **sales** for the dates in this file. \n* The dates in the test data are for the 15 days after the last date in the training data.\n\n\n### Submission file: sample_submission.csv\nA sample submission file in the correct format.\n\n### Additional information\n#### 1. Store metadata: stores.csv\n  * Store metadata, including **city**, **state**, **type**, and **cluster**.\n  * **cluster** is a grouping of similar stores.\n\n#### 2. Daily oil price: oil.csv \nIncludes values during both the train and test data timeframes. (Ecuador is an oil-dependent country and it's economical health is highly vulnerable to shocks in oil prices.)\n\n#### 3. Holidays and Events, with metadata: holidays_events.csv\n  * NOTE: Pay special attention to the **transferred** column. A holiday that is transferred officially falls on that calendar day, but was moved to another date by the government. A transferred day is more like a normal day than a holiday. To find the day that it was actually celebrated, look for the corresponding row where type is Transfer. For example, the holiday Independencia de Guayaquil was transferred from 2012-10-09 to 2012-10-12, which means it was celebrated on 2012-10-12. Days that are type Bridge are extra days that are added to a holiday (e.g., to extend the break across a long weekend). These are frequently made up by the type Work Day which is a day not normally scheduled for work (e.g., Saturday) that is meant to payback the Bridge.\n  * Additional holidays are days added a regular calendar holiday, for example, as typically happens around Christmas (making Christmas Eve a holiday).\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n* Wages in the public sector are paid every two weeks on the 15 th and on the last day of the month. Supermarket sales could be affected by this.\n* A magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Ecuador on April 16, 2016. People rallied in relief efforts donating water and other first need products which greatly affected supermarket sales for several weeks after the earthquake.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image:

**Serial depencdence** that leads to [cycles](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/time-series-as-features), and can be explored through lag features.\n\nEach of these features are worth exploring one-by-one in detail. We are goinig to follow the lead of the tutorial in realising that a single machine learning algorithm might not be best-suited to capture all these independent components. While regression algorithms are better for detrending/deseasonalising, [serial dependence is best explored through **decision trees**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/time-series-as-features).

In this context a season can mean a week, month, year or an actual 'season' (e.g., Vivaldi's \"The Four Seasons\"). However, depending on the number of observations in a season, we might use **two distinct features** to model seasonality:\n\n* [Seasonal indicators](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/seasonality#Seasonal-Plots-and-Seasonal-Indicators): For a season with few observations (eg, a weekly season of daily observations) seasonal differences in the level of the time series (eg, difference between daily observations in a week) can be represented through binary features, or more specifically, one-hot-encoded categorical features. These features are called **seasonal indicators** and can be represented through seasonal plots.\n* [Fourier features](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/seasonality#Fourier-Features-and-the-Periodogram): Seasonal indicators create a feature for every unit of the period of the season. Hence, they have the tendency to blow up for long seasons, e.g., daily observations over a year.

These two make sense in view of the notes to the Store Sales dataset which mentions that wages in the public sector are paid out biweekly, on the 15th and last day of the month -- a possible origin for these seasons.\n\nAlready after these two features, we get down to weekly features which can be described through seasonal indicators.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Creating seasonal features (also including linear trend)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"y = store_sales.unstack(['store_nbr', 'family']).loc[\"2017\"]\n\n# Fourier features\nfourier = CalendarFourier(freq='M', order=4) ## 2 pairs of sine/cosine curves to model monthly/biweekly seasonality\ndp = DeterministicProcess(\n    index=y.index,\n    constant=True,               # dummy feature for bias (y-intercept)\n    order=1,                     # cubic trend\n    seasonal=True,               # weekly seasonality (indicators)\n    additional_terms=[fourier],  # annual seasonality (fourier)\n    drop=True,                   # drop terms to avoid collinearity\n)\n\nX = dp.in_sample()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-06T16:12:26.999935Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-06T16:12:27.000846Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-06T16:12:27.869583Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-06T16:12:27.000811Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-06T16:12:27.868918Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=15, shuffle=False)\n\nmodel = LinearRegression(fit_intercept=False).fit(X_train, y_train)\n\ny_fit = pd.DataFrame(model.predict(X_train), index=X_train.index, columns=y_train.columns).clip(0.0)\ny_pred = pd.DataFrame(model.predict(X_valid), index=X_valid.index, columns=y_valid.columns).clip(0.0)\n\nrmsle_train = mean_squared_log_error(y_train, y_fit) ** 0.5\nrmsle_valid = mean_squared_log_error(y_valid, y_pred) ** 0.5\nprint(f'Training RMSLE: {rmsle_train:.5f}')\nprint(f'Validation RMSLE: {rmsle_valid:.5f}')\n\ny_pred.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-06T16:12:27.870743Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-06T16:12:27.87101Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-06T16:12:28.097082Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-06T16:12:27.870986Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-06T16:12:28.096117Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Second submission: based on (linear) trends + seasonality","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create features for test set\nX_test = dp.out_of_sample(steps=16)\nX_test.index.name = 'date'\n\nX_test.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-06T16:12:28.098519Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-06T16:12:28.099744Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-06T16:12:28.127966Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-06T16:12:28.099656Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-06T16:12:28.126618Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"y_submit = pd.DataFrame(model.predict(X_test), index=X_test.index, columns=y.columns)\ny_submit = y_submit.stack(['store_nbr', 'family'])\ny_submit = y_submit.join(df_test.id).reindex(columns=['id', 'sales'])\ny_submit.to_csv('submission_trend_seasonality_2017.csv', index=False)\n\ny_submit.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-06T16:12:28.129571Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-06T16:12:28.129978Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-06T16:12:28.528871Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-06T16:12:28.129948Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-06T16:12:28.527219Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## [Public Score: 0.58780](https://www.kaggle.com/code/abhirupghosh184098/store-sales-forecasting-a-comprehensive-guide?scriptVersionId=111669039)\n\nWe achieve our best score yet by:\n* restricting to 2017 data\n* assuming a linear trend\n* incorporating seasonality through:\n  * setting day-of-the-week seasonal indicators\n  * fourier features to represent monthly/bi-weekly behaviour (primarily influenced by wage-timings)\n  \nBefore we close the chapter on time-dependence and move on to serial dependence, there is one last piece of information we can add: **information about holidays**.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Quick digression: Deseasonalising/Detrending","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As a quick check of the effectiveness of our seasonality modelling, we can do a **residual analysis**.

This is because the data preparation for forecasting using serial dependence is distinctly different and more challenging than when we were using deterministic features like trends and seasonality to make predictions for the out-of-training-range test set dates.\n\nAs highlighted in the [tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/forecasting-with-machine-learning), we could easily create forecasts for any time in the future by just generating our desired trend and seasonal features. However, when we added lag features, the nature of the problem changed. Lag features require that the lagged target value is known at the time being forecast.

With the recursive method, we feed a model's 1-step forecast back in to that same model to use as a lag feature for the next forecasting step.

Having said that, there are a few things one could do to improve on the analysis presented here:\n\n* include additional information provided in this competition itself, eg, oil prices, transactions data and store details\n* engineering features other than those directly related to aspects of a time series\n* focus on modelling by exploring the best choice of parameters (through hyper-parameter tuning) or evaluating the models themselves by seeing which model is best validated for our time-series forecasting\n* and finally, use forecasting strategies other than the recursive strategy we have used here.\n\nI hope you had fun reading this; and see you soon in another notebook. :)","metadata":{}}]}
