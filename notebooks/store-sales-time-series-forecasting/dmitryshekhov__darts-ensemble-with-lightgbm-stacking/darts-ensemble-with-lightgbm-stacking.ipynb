Thanks to them, I picked up interesting ideas, their development gave a good score: 0.3804.\n\nThe key difference lies in the technique of combining model predictions. While he employed blending in work, I opted for a different approach - stacking. Also, I used another type of encoding and hyperparameters for the models.\n\nFirst of all, I will focus on a detailed description of the used approach. If you need more information about EDA and data preparation, I suggest reading the works of others authors.\n\nThey comprehensively described these steps, so there is no need to dwell on them again.\n\nBut first things first.Before using  Darts with stacking, I tried other techniques and I'm happy to share the results. Perhaps this will help save time by avoiding going in the wrong direction.\n\n<b>Here some score of them</b>:\n- Prophet 1782 timeseries with exogenus seasonality by years and covariates: 0.59676\n- SARIMAX 1782 timeseries with exogenus seasonality by years: 0.46409\n- as a previous plus target variable log1p transformation : 0.49116\n- hybrid models: SARIMAX prediction for main data and LightGBM training on residuals:  0.48831\n- CatBoost 54 timeseries grouped by families: 0.53593\n- LightGBM 54 timeseries grouped by families: 0.47366\n- as a previous plus target variable log1p transformation : 0.42178\n\nDarts:\n- LightGBM + One hot + Blending 4 lags: 0.38127\n- LightGBM + Ordinal: 0.3839\n- LightGBM + Ordinal + without Scaler: 0.38697\n- LightGBM + Ordinal+ Blending 4 lags: 0.38107\n- LightGBM + Ordinal + Blending 6 lags: 0.38055\n- LightGBM + Ordinal + Blending 6 lags + Robust Scaler: 0.39995","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Setup","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-19T08:34:51.103055Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-19T08:34:51.103594Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-19T08:34:51.143973Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-19T08:34:51.103547Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-19T08:34:51.142823Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install darts &> /dev/null","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-19T08:34:51.146212Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-19T08:34:51.14685Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-19T08:35:40.899239Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-19T08:34:51.146812Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-19T08:35:40.897104Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import darts\nprint(darts.__version__)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-19T08:35:40.901765Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-19T08:35:40.902177Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-19T08:35:41.916643Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-19T08:35:40.902101Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-19T08:35:41.915046Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-19T08:35:41.920244Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-19T08:35:41.921069Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-19T08:35:41.927113Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-19T08:35:41.92102Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-19T08:35:41.925726Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import Data\nOur objective is to forecast 16 days sales of 54 stores in Ecuador based on data from the period of January 01, 2013, to August 15, 2017.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### train","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-19T08:35:41.934161Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-19T08:35:41.934996Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-19T08:35:41.941753Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-19T08:35:41.93493Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-19T08:35:41.940389Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_train = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/train.csv')\ndisplay(df_train.head())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-19T08:35:41.943555Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-19T08:35:41.944482Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-19T08:35:45.742477Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-19T08:35:41.944402Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-19T08:35:45.741223Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Please note that we do not have sales data for December 25 of each year.
