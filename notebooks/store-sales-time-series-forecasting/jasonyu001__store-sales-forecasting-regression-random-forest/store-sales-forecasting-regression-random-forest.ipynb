Our goal was to build a model that could accurately predict the unit sales of items sold at different stores. An accurate forecasting can decrease food waste related to overstocking and improve customer satisfaction.\n\nAmong the six available data files, we analyzed three of them, which are train, test, and stores. Although we did not study the effects of daily oil price or the holiday events in this project, we anticipate to spend additional time outside of this class to dive deeper for our learning and growth.\n\nIn our analysis, we explored two different models for time sereies forecasting: linear regression and random forest. Through preparing the data for linear regression, we came across some interesting insights, including sale increases on weekends, sale increases around the time the public sector is paid wages, and sale increases during November and December. We also noticed many massive decreases in sales throughout 2014 and 2015. Both of these increases and decreases could be due to store promotions, holidays, oil prices, or world events, which we were not able to investigate in our analysis.\n\nFor linear regression, we removed product families that were not being sold at that particular store, clustered the stores, and grouped the lower selling products into one product family. We investigated and removed outliers, and assessed the seasonality of the training data.\n\nFor random forest, we processed the categorical variables and removed the outliers.\n\nLinear regression proved to be inefficient and displayed exponential qualities, while random forest proved to be an easier model to implement. However, without the data processing for linear regression, we would not have been able to discover the insights that we did, as random forest is a black-box model.\n\nWe also included some final thoughts in regards to feature importance, hyperparameter optimization, and further findings on residual plots.\n\nIn conclusion, random forest was the better model for forcasting stores sales.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n#It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n#For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n#Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n#For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n#You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n#You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-11T21:10:10.730597Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-11T21:10:10.731188Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-11T21:10:11.293464Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-11T21:10:10.731129Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-11T21:10:11.292089Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.

As this is the most basic method of regression, this would help us determine what our next steps should be. If the model performed well, we could then use linear regression to forecast the sales. However, this model proved to be poor and we can see this during the data cleaning process, adjusted R-squared, and residual and normal probability plots.\n\nFirst, data processing took a considerable amount of time. As stated above, there are 54 stores and 33 product families, which already create too many different variables in our data, forcing us to cluster and group. There is also seasonality to deal with, and for us to do this with multiple regression, we had to create dummies, which again creates way too many variables. In order not to violate parsimony, having too many variables is not a good idea, and the amount of processing that needed to be done just to prepare the dataset for linear regression was inefficient. As the seasonality appeared to be additive, we could have explored an exponential smoothing method such as Holt-Winters, but we have chosen not to pursue it here.\n\nAs our model included many predictor variables, we will look at the adjusted R-squared values, which were poor for each cluster run with linear regression. Although some clusters output an adjusted R-squared value above 0.7, which is considered to be good, majority presented with R-squared values around 0.5. This means that about 50% of the time, our model does not capture the variations in number of sales. However, the p-values for the predictor variables in all runs were less than 0.05, indicating that they are significant.\n\nA first look at the residual plot for cluster 1 shows that the points are randomized, and the normal probability plot is almost a straight line. These are representations of a good model. However, as we continue to look through the residual plots, we notice that there does appear to be a pattern among them. Although we are not able to define this pattern based on our knowledge of different types of regression, the pattern does prove that the linear regression model we have used is not a good fit. Some of the normal probability plots are also exhibiting exponential growth, most notably, the plots for clusters 12, 15, and 16. In this case, we could try using an exponential trend model by taking the logarithm of sales, but due to time restraints and the fact that we know the regression model is not a good fit here, we have chosen not to explore the exponential trend at this time.\n\nWe have concluded that model 1 is not a good model for forecasting the stores sales in this dataset due to the amount of variables, adjusted R-squared, and residual plots. However, we do note that this model was created after we omitted other variables such as promotion, holidays, and oil prices from our analysis. Had we chosen to include those, we may have received better results, but at this time we will not be using it to make any predictions, and will instead move on to another technique which could potentially give us better results.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 7. Model 2: Random Forest\n\nOur second approach to creating a model for forecasting store sales in Random Forest. In summary, Random Forest is a supervised learning and ensemble algorithm that is an extension of decision trees. It can be used both on classification and regression models with high accuracy, and is able to handle large datasets efficiently. However, it is black-box model as we cannot really interpret the individual decision trees within the random forest.\n\nRandom Forest is able to handle many stores, product families, and seasonality within our data, so we will not need to worry about grouping, creating dummies, and taking the logarithm of sales. As such, we can go back and look at our unprocessed data.
