Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data. Examples of time series are heights of ocean tides, counts of sunspots, and the daily closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nA Time series is very frequently plotted via a run chart (which is a temporal line chart). Time series are used in statistics, signal processing, pattern recognition, econometrics, mathematical finance, weather forecasting, earthquake prediction, electroencephalography, control engineering, astronomy, communications engineering, and largely in any domain of applied science and engineering which involves temporal measurements.\n\nTime series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values. While regression analysis is often employed in such a way as to test relationships between one or more different time series, this type of analysis is not usually called \"time series analysis\", which refers in particular to relationships between different points in time within a single series. Interrupted time series analysis is used to detect changes in the evolution of a time series from before to after some intervention which may affect the underlying variable.\n\n![Exampl2-1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Random-data-plus-trend-r2.png)| ![Example-2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Tuberculosis_incidence_US_1953-2009.png) | \n\n\n### Tools\n\nTools for investigating time-series data include:\n\n- Consideration of the *autocorrelation|autocorrelation function-and the *Spectral density|spectral density function-(also *cross-correlation function*s and cross-spectral density functions)\n- *Scaled correlation|Scaled-cross- and auto-correlation functions to remove contributions of slow components\n- Performing a *Fourier transform-to investigate the series in the *frequency domain*\n- Use of a *digital filter|filter-to remove unwanted *noise (physics)|noise*\n- *Principal component analysis-(or *empirical orthogonal function-analysis)\n- *Singular spectrum analysis*\n- \"Structural\" models:\n- General *State Space Model*s\n- Unobserved Components Models\n- *Machine Learning*\n> - *Artificial neural network*s\n> - *Support vector machine*\n> - *Fuzzy logic*\n> - *Gaussian process*\n> - *Hidden Markov model*\n- *Queueing theory-analysis\n- *Control chart*\n> - *Shewhart individuals control chart*\n> - *CUSUM-chart\n> - *EWMA chart*\n- *Detrended fluctuation analysis*\n- *Nonlinear mixed-effects model|Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling*\n- *Dynamic time warping*\n- *Cross-correlation*\n- *Dynamic Bayesian network*\n- *Time-frequency representation|Time-frequency analysis techniques:*\n> - *Fast Fourier transform*\n> - *Continuous wavelet transform*\n> - *Short-time Fourier transform*\n> - *Chirplet transform*\n> - *Fractional Fourier transform*\n- *Chaos theory|Chaotic analysis*\n> - *Correlation dimension*\n> - *Recurrence plot*s\n> - *Recurrence quantification analysis*\n> - *Lyapunov exponent*s\n> - *Entropy encoding*\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"timeseriestools\"></a>\n<h1 style='background:#B2FF33; border:0;'><center>Time Series Tools</center></h1>\n\n### I evaluated the following Time Series Python Libraries for this exercise.
