A time series dataset typically consists of a sequence of data points collected over time, with each data point representing a <b>measurement or observation</b> at a specific point in time.\n\nTime series forecasting is different from other types of prediction problems because it involves analyzing the temporal patterns and trends in the data. This means that the order of the data points matters, and that there may be <b>seasonality, trends,residuals, and other patterns</b> that need to be accounted for in order to make accurate predictions.\n\n<b>ML</b> models can be trained to automatically detect and account for variables that affect the target variable, such as promotions and special days, and can be used to generate accurate forecasts for a wide range of time series datasets.\n\n<b>AIMs</b>\n\nWe aim to develop a flexible and scalable framework that can be applied to a wide range of time series datasets, while accounting for variables that can affect the target variable, and examining the relationship between ensemble techniques and forecasting error.\n\nBy combining the strengths of multiple ML models and techniques, we aim to achieve better forecasting performance and gain deeper insights into the underlying patterns and trends in the data.\n    </div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div class = 'alert alert-block alert-success'>\n    METHODOLOGY:\n    </div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style = 'border: 3px solid #f0ad4e; background-color: #fcf8e3; padding: 10px;'>\n\n1. Data Preprocessing: The first step is to prepare the time series dataset for analysis.\n\n2. Stationarity Test: The next step is to test the time series for stationarity.\n\n3. Determine Order of Differencing: If the time series is found to be non-stationary, the next step is to determine the order of differencing required to achieve stationarity.\n\n4. Identify Order of AR and MA Terms: Once the time series is stationary, the next step is to identify the order of the autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) terms in the ARIMA model. This can be done by analyzing the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions of the time series.\n\n5. Fit ARIMA Model: With the order of differencing, AR and MA terms identified, the next step is to fit the ARIMA model to the time series data.\n\n6. Model Diagnostics: After fitting the model, the next step is to evaluate its performance using diagnostic checks.\n\n7. Forecasting:The accuracy of the forecasts can be evaluated using measures such as mean absolute error (MAE) or mean squared error (MSE).\n\n8.

A unit root implies that the series is non-stationary and its properties change over time, making it difficult to make reliable predictions.\n\nIn your case, the ADF statistic is -2.931646. This value indicates the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis of a unit root being present in the time series. The lower the ADF statistic, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\nThe p-value of 0.041790 is the probability of observing an ADF statistic as extreme as or more extreme than the observed value under the null hypothesis of a unit root. In other words, it tells you how likely it is that the ADF statistic is a result of random chance rather than a true indication of a non-stationary time series.\n\nIn this case, the p-value is less than 0.05, which means that we can reject the null hypothesis of a unit root with 95% confidence level, and conclude that the time series is stationary.\n\nThe critical values of the ADF test are provided for comparison with the observed ADF statistic. They indicate the threshold values that the ADF statistic needs to exceed in order to reject the null hypothesis of a unit root at different significance levels. In your case, the critical values at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels are -3.434, -2.863, and -2.568, respectively. Since the observed ADF statistic is greater than the critical value at the 1% and 5% levels, we can reject the null hypothesis with 99% and 95% confidence, respectively.\n</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<details>\n    <summary>\n        <font color = 'blue'><h1>About</h1></font>\n    </summary>\n    <p>\n\n1. **The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Statistic:** This measures the test statistic of the ADF test. It is a negative number, and the more negative it is, the stronger the evidence for rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e., the more likely the time series is stationary).\n\n2. **p-value:** This measures the probability of observing the ADF statistic under the null hypothesis that the time series is non-stationary. The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence for rejecting the null hypothesis.\n\n3. **Critical Values:** These are pre-defined thresholds for the ADF statistic beyond which we can reject the null hypothesis with a certain level of confidence. There are different critical values for different levels of significance (e.g., 1%, 5%, 10%). If the ADF statistic is lower than the critical values, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the time series is stationary.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div class = 'alert alert-block alert-success'>\n    <h2>Determine Order of Differencing</h2>\n    </div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose\n\n# decompose the time series\ndecomposition = seasonal_decompose(train['sales'], model='additive', period=12)\n\n# create a seasonal plot\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=4, ncols=1, figsize=(10,20))\nfig.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.5) # added space between subplots\n\ndecomposition.observed.plot(ax=axes[0], legend=False)\naxes[0].set_ylabel('Observed')\naxes[0].set_title('Observed Seasonal Plot')\n\ndecomposition.trend.plot(ax=axes[1], legend=False)\naxes[1].set_ylabel('Trend')\naxes[1].set_title('Trend Plot')\n\ndecomposition.seasonal.plot(ax=axes[2], legend=False)\naxes[2].set_ylabel('Seasonal')\naxes[2].set_title('Seasonal Plot')\n\ndecomposition.resid.plot(ax=axes[3], legend=False)\naxes[3].set_ylabel('Residual')\naxes[3].set_title('Residual Plot')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-12T04:49:00.779421Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-12T04:49:00.778427Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-12T04:49:02.011965Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-12T04:49:02.011006Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-12T04:49:00.779355Z"}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style = 'border : 3px solid #f0ad4e; background-color : #fcf8e3 ; padding :10px; '>\n'As we can see, we have some seasonal pattern in the series and a high correlation between the present and past value and we don't have white noise in the series because we have this correlation.
