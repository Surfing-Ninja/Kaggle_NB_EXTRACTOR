If there are some ready-to-use external features and data, let's use it to speed up the overall progress.  \nIn this scenario always make sense to check that new external features have optimal representation for specific task and target model architecture. Example - category features for linear regression models should be one-hot-encoded.\nThis type of feature preparation should be done manually in any case.  \nSame as scenario #1, there is a caveat to this approach: a lot of features not always a good thing - they might lead to dimensionality increase and model overfitting.  \nYou have to check model accuracy improvement metrics after enrichment with the new features and ALWAYS with appropriate cross-validation strategy.\n \nIn this Guide we'll go with **Scenario #1**. Also you can check out Part #2 Guide for the [**Scenario #2**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/romaupgini/zero-feature-engineering-with-upgini-pycaret), and another example for Scenario #1 - [Part
