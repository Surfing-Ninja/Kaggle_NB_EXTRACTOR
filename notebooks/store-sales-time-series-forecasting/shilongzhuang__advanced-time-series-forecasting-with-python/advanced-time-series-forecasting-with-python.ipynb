Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs)\n\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that are particularly well suited for time series forecasting. LSTMs are able to capture long-term dependencies in time series data by using memory cells that can retain information for extended periods of time.\n\nLSTMs take in the historical time series data as input, and use this data to learn the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. Once trained, the LSTM can then be used to make predictions about future events in the time series.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First, load the necessary libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense\nfrom keras.layers import LSTM\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\nfrom keras.preprocessing.sequence import TimeseriesGenerator","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-01-18T07:59:56.372496Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-01-18T07:59:56.372886Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-01-18T07:59:56.379209Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-01-18T07:59:56.372854Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-01-18T07:59:56.378035Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Then, load the data and prepare it for the LSTM model.
