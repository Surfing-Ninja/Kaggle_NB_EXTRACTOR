With those preliminaries out of the way, we can jump in and start learning Python. In this short lesson, we'll learn how to use Python to do arithmetic operations.\n\nPython allows you to perform all of the basic mathematical computations that you can perform on a calculator, using syntax similar to what you'd expect if you were using a calculator. To perform arithmetic with Python, simply type the operation you wish to perform into a code cell and then run the cell to view the result. (Remember, if you like you can fork this notebook using the blue button at the top of the screen and then run code cells yourself by selecting the cell you wish to run and pressing control + enter.).\n\nUse the + sign to perform addition:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"10 + 5","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Use the - sign to perform subtraction:\n\nNote: putting a - sign in front of a number makes it negative."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"10 - 5","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Use * for multiplication:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"10 * 5","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Use / for decimal division:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"10 / 3","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Use // for floor division (Round decimal remainders down):"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"10 // 3","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Use ** for exponentiation:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"10 ** 3","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Math expressions in Python follow the normal arithmetic order of operations so * and / are executed before + and - and ** is executed before multiplication and division.\n\nNote: Lines within Python code that begin with \"#\" are text comments.
