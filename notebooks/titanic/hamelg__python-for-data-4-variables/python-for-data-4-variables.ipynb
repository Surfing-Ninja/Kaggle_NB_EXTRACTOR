A variable is a name you assign a value or object, such as one of the basic data types that we learned about last time.

Reassigning a variable simply switches the reference to a different object in memory. If the object a variable refers to in memory is altered in some way, the value of the variable corresponding to the altered object will also change. All of the basic data types we've seen thus far are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after they are created. If you perform some operation that appears to alter an immutable object, it is actually creating a totally new object in memory, rather than changing the original immutable object.\n\nConsider the following example:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"x = \"Hello\"     # Create a new string\ny = x           # Assign y the same object as x\ny = y.lower()   # Assign y the result of y.lower()\nprint(x)\nprint(y)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nIn the case above, we first assign x the value \"Hello\", a string object stored somewhere in memory. Next we use the string method lower() to make the string assigned to y lowercase. Since strings are immutable, Python creates an entirely new string, \"hello\" and stores it somewhere in memory separate from the original \"Hello\" object. As a result, x and y refer to different objects in memory and produce different results when printed to the console.\n\nBy contrast, lists are a mutable data structure that can hold multiple objects. If you alter a list, Python doesn't make an entirely new list in memory: it changes the actual list object itself. This can lead to seemingly inconsistent and confusing behavior:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"x = [1,2,3]    # Create a new list\ny = x          # Assign y the same object as x\ny.append(4)    # Add 4 to the end of list y\nprint(x)\nprint(y)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this case, x and y still both refer to the same original list, so both x and y have the same value, even though it may appear that the code only added the number 4 to list y."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Wrap Up"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Variables are a basic coding construct used across all programming languages. Many data applications involve assigning data to some variables and then passing those variables on to functions that perform various operations on the data.\n\nThis lesson briefly introduced the concept of tuples and lists, which are sequence data types that can hold several values. In the next lesson, we will dig deeper into these sorts of compound data types."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Next Lesson: [Python for Data 5: Lists](https://www.kaggle.com/hamelg/python-for-data-5-lists)\n[back to index](https://www.kaggle.com/hamelg/python-for-data-analysis-index)"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
