Ordering can be useful in some cases, such as if your data is sorted or has some other natural sense of ordering, but it comes at a price. When you search through sequences like lists, your computer has to go through each element one at a time to find an object you're looking for.\n\nConsider the following code:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"my_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]\n\n0 in my_list","execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":1,"data":{"text/plain":"False"},"metadata":{}}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"When running the code above, Python has to search through the entire list, one item at a time before it returns that 0 is not in the list. This sequential searching isn't much of a concern with small lists like this one, but if you're working with data that contains thousands or millions of values, it can add up quickly.\n\nDictionaries and sets are unordered Python data structures that solve this issue using a technique called [hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function). We won't go into the details of their implementation, but dictionaries and sets let you check whether they contain objects without having to search through each element one at a time, at the cost of having no order and using a bit more system memory."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Dictionaries"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A [dictionary](https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) or dict is an object that maps a set of named indexes called keys to a set of corresponding values.
