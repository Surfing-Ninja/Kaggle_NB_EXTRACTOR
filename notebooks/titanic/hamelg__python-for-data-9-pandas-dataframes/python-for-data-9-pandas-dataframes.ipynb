To store data from an external source like an excel workbook or database, we need a data structure that can hold different data types. It is also desirable to be able to refer to rows and columns in the data by custom labels rather than numbered indexes.\n\nThe pandas library offers data structures designed with this in mind: the series and the DataFrame.
